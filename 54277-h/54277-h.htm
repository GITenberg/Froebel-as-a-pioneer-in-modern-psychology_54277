<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Some day Froebel will come to his own, and the carefulness
of his observation, the depth of his thought,
the truth of his theories, and the success of his actual
experiments in education will all be acknowledged.</p>

<p>There are few schools nowadays so modern as the
short-lived Keilhau, with its spirit of freedom and
independence and its “Areopagus” in which the boys
themselves judged grave misdemeanours while the
masters settled smaller matters alone. There are few
schools now which have such an all-round curriculum,
including, as it did, the mother tongue as well as
classics and modern languages; ancient and modern
history; Nature study and Nature rambles; school
journeys, lasting for two or three weeks and extending
as far as Switzerland for the older lads, while the
younger boys visited German towns and were made
acquainted with peasant life; definite instruction in
field-work, in building and carpentry, etc.; religious
teaching in which Middendorf endeavoured “to show
the merits of the religions of all nations”; physical
training with the out-of-doors wrestling ground and
shooting stand and gymnasium “for every spare
moment of the winter,” and organized games; and
dramatic teaching where “classic dramas” and other
plays were performed, and for which the boys built
the stage and painted the scenes. There was even
co-education, “flirtation being unknown,” because
all had their heads so full of more important matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
but where free intercourse of boy and girl “softened
the manners of the young German savages.”</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to show that all these
things, besides the Kindergarten and the excellent plan
for the Helba Institute, did not come into being by
chance, but were the outcome of the deep reflection
of a man who combined the scientific with the philosophic
temperament; and who, because his ideal as a
teacher was “Education by Development,” had made
a special study of the instinctive tendencies, and the
requirements of different stages of child development,
as I have tried to prove in Chapters VI and VII.</p>

<p>I should like to explain one or two points, first, that
though for all quotations I have referred to the most
commonly used translations of Froebel’s writings, yet
I have frequently given my own rendering when the
other seemed inadequate; secondly, that I have
endeavoured to give the context as often as possible,
and have also given the actual German words, that I
might not be accused of reading in modern ideas which
are not really in the text; and, lastly, that I have
purposely repeated quotations rather than give my
readers the trouble of turning back to another page.</p>

<p>In conclusion may I take this opportunity of paying
grateful thanks first to Miss Alice Words and to Miss
K. M. Clarke, without whose kind encouragement I
should never have completed my task, and also to
Professor Alexander for several helpful suggestions,
and to Miss Ida Sachs for friendly help.</p>

<span class="smcap">Froebel’s Anticipation of Modern Psychology</span></h2>

<p class="center">“<cite>A great man condemns the world to the task of explaining
him.</cite>”</p>

<p>The purpose of this little book is to show that
Froebel’s educational theories were based on
psychological views of a type much more modern
than is at all generally understood. It is frequently
stated that Froebel’s psychology is conspicuous by its
absence, but in a somewhat close study of Froebel’s
writings I have been again and again surprised to find
how much Froebel seems to have anticipated modern
psychology.</p>

<p>A probable reason for the overlooking of so much
sound psychological truth is to be found in the fact that
much of it is obscured by details which seem to us
trivial, but which Froebel meant as applications of the
theories he was endeavouring to make clear to minds
not only innocent of, but incapable of, psychology.</p>

<p>Most educationists have read “The Education of
Man,” but few outside the Kindergarten world are
likely to have bestowed much thought on Froebel’s
later writings. It is in these, however, that we see
Froebel watching with earnest attention that earliest
mental development which is now regarded as a distinct
chapter in mental science, but which was then largely
if not entirely ignored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>With the same spirit of inquiry and the same field
for investigation&mdash;for children acted and thought then
as they act and think now&mdash;it is only natural that
Froebel should have made at least some of the same
discoveries as the genetic psychologist of to-day.</p>

<p>It would be unfair at any date to expect a complete
psychology from a writer whose subject is not
mental science, but education. Mistakes, too, one must
expect, and these are not to be ignored.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Still there
remains a solid amount of psychological discovery
for which Froebel has had as yet but little credit.</p>

<p>Indeed, just as his disciples have been inclined,
like all disciples, to think that their master has said the
last word on his own subject, so have opponents of
Froebelian doctrines, irritated perhaps by these pretensions,
made direct attacks on somewhat insufficient
grounds. In a later chapter, an attempt has been
made to deal with what seems unfounded in such
attacks.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The major part of the book, however, is intended to
show the correctness of Froebel’s views on points now
regarded as of fundamental importance, and generally
recognized as modern theories. For this purpose passages
from Froebel’s writings are here compared with similar
passages from such undoubted authorities as Dr. James
Ward, Professor Stout, Professor Lloyd Morgan, Mr.
W. Macdougall, Mr. J. Irving King, and others.</p>

<p>In the first place, it should be noted that Froebel
was fully aware of the necessity for a psychological
basis for his educational theories.</p>

<p>Writing in 1841, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am firmly convinced that all the phenomena
of the child world, those which delight us, as well
as those which grieve us, depend upon fixed laws as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
definite as those of the cosmos, the planetary
system and the operations of Nature; it is therefore
possible to discover them and examine them.
When once we know and have assimilated these
laws, we shall be able powerfully to counteract
any retrograde and faulty tendencies in children,
and to encourage, at the same time, all that is
good and virtuous.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 91.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Nor was Froebel in any doubt as to how these laws
are to be discovered, and his order of investigation is
very similar to that prescribed by Professor Stout.
The latter, though regarding genetic psychology as
“the most important and most interesting,” considers
that it should be preceded by:&mdash;1, A general analysis
of consciousness, analytic and largely introspective;
2, An investigation of the laws of mental process,
“analytic also, inasmuch as we endeavour to ascertain
the general laws of mental process by analysis of the
fully developed mind.”</p>

<p>Froebel, too, regards the analytic as a necessary
preparation for the genetic, and says that parents and
teachers, who wish to supply the needs of the child at
different stages of development:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“are to consider life <em>firstly</em> through looking into
themselves, into the course of their own development,
its phenomena and its claims&mdash;through the
retrospection (Rückblick) of the earliest possible
years of their own lives, and also the introspection
(Einblick) of their present lives, that their own
experience may furnish a key to the problem of
the child’s condition (den Zustand des Kindes in
sich zu lösen). <em>Secondly</em>, by the deepest possible
search into the life of the child, and into what
he must necessarily require according to his present
stage of development.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 168.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Stout adds later that anthropology and
philology may ultimately yield results as important as
those yielded by physiology. Froebel could have no
idea of the physiological parallel to mental process,
but he did not omit the anthropological inquiry, for in
another passage he enlarges his first point, declaring
that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is essential for parents and teachers, for
the sake of their children, and that their educational
efforts may meet with a rich reward, not only to
recall as far as possible the first phenomena, the
course and conditions of the development of their
own lives, but that they should compare this with
the phenomena, the course and conditions of the
development of the world, and of life in general in
Nature and History, and so by degrees raise themselves
to a knowledge of the general as well as of
the particular laws of life development, that the
guidance of the child may find in these laws a higher
and stronger&mdash;their true foundation, as well as
their surest determination.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 66.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Even his detractors generally allow that Froebel
had a wonderful insight into child-nature, but this is
too often spoken of as if it were due to some specialized
faculty of intuition, not known to psychology.</p>

<p>Froebel’s knowledge of child-nature came to him
precisely as it comes to the psychologist of the present
day, through patient observation of the doings of little
children, and thoughtful interpretation of their possible
meaning. It is true that he drew his conclusions from
too narrow a field, but of this he was well aware. In
a letter to a cousin thanking her for the “comparative
account of the various manifestations of children,”
which she had sent him, he complains, <em>and this, be it
remembered, in 1840</em>, that “it is a subject to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
one can rarely get even cultivated parents to pay
attention,” and he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I would beg of you to collect as many observations
for me as you can, both things which you
yourself have observed, and also remarks made by
your Robert and the other children when at play.
If you have the time for this, pray do it for the
furtherance of the cause; other friends are at work
for me in the same way.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 67.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In another letter to this cousin he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would delight me greatly if you could confide
to me what you remember of your feelings,
perceptions, and ideas as a mother greeting the
new-born life of her infant, and your observations
of the first movements of its limbs and the beginning
of the development of its senses.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 110.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To another friend he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the interests of the children I have still
another request to make&mdash;that you would record
in writing the most important facts about each
separate child. It seems to me most necessary for
the comprehension, and for the true treatment of
child-nature, that such observations should be made
public from time to time, in order that children
may become better and better understood in their
manifestations, and may therefore be more rightly
treated, and that true care and observation of
unsophisticated childhood may ever increase.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 89.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel made these requests, as he made his own
observations, as the result of the conviction with which
he declares himself “thoroughly penetrated,”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“that the movements of the young and delicate
mind of the child, although as yet so small as to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
almost unnoticeable, are of the most essential
consequence to his future life.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 53.</cite></p>

<p>“Why do we observe the child less than the
germ of a plant? Is it to be supposed that in the
child, the capacity to become a complete human
being is contained less than in the acorn is contained
the capacity to become a strong, vigorous
and complete oak?”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 62.</cite></p>

<p>“We cannot pass over unmentioned the fact,
essential for the whole life of the child, for the
whole course of his development, that phenomena
and impressions which seem to us insignificant,
and which we generally leave unnoticed, have for
the child, and especially for his inner world, most
important results, since the child develops more
through what seems to us small and imperceptible,
than through what appears to us large and striking
… hence&mdash;wholly contrary to prevailing opinion&mdash;nowhere
is consideration of that which is small
and insignificant of more importance than in the
nursery.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 125.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor Dewey, one of the few important educational
writers who do justice to Froebel as a pioneer,
gives as a general summary of his educational principles:</p>

<p>“1. That the primary business of school is to train
children in co-operative and mutually helpful living;
to foster in them the consciousness of mutual interdependence,
and to help them practically in making
the adjustments that will carry this spirit into overt
deeds.</p>

<p>“2. That the primary root of all educative activity
is in the instinctive, impulsive attitudes and activities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of the child, and not in the presentation and application
of external material, whether through the ideas of
others or through the senses; and that, accordingly,
numberless spontaneous activities of children, plays,
games, mimic efforts, even the apparently meaningless
motions of infants&mdash;exhibitions previously ignored as
trivial, futile, or even condemned as positively evil&mdash;are
capable of educational use, nay, are the foundation-stones
of educational effort.</p>

<p>“3. That these individual tendencies and activities
are organized and directed through the uses made of
them in keeping up the co-operative living already
spoken of; taking advantage of them to reproduce on
the child’s plane the typical doings and occupations of
the larger maturer society into which he is finally
to go forth; and that it is through production and
creative use that valuable knowledge is secured and
clinched.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>So little, however, are these principles understood
as Froebel’s, that in the Pedagogical Seminary for
July, 1900, a paper was published on “The Reconstruction
of the Kindergarten,” wherein it was maintained
that the basis of reconstruction must be the child’s
natural instincts. The writer, Mr. Eby, had apparently
no idea that the Kindergarten was originally based on
this very foundation. He evidently did not know that
Froebel has given, in his “Education of Man,” a very
fair account of these instincts, omitting nothing of great
importance, and pointing, at least, to a better principle
of classification than that adopted by Mr. Eby.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is,
however, only fair to Froebel to mention that he himself
regarded his own account as far from being commensurate
with the importance of the subject, for the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
following that of the publication of “The Education
of Man” he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Since these spontaneous activities of children
have not yet been thoroughly thought out from a
high point of view, and have not yet been regarded
from what I might almost call their cosmical and
anthropological side, we may from day to day
expect some philosopher to write a comprehensive
book about them.”&mdash;<cite>A., p. 76.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The problems Froebel endeavoured to solve are
precisely those which are absorbing the genetic
psychologist of the present day, as stated, for example,
in Mr. Irving King’s “Psychology of Child Development,”
viz.: “to examine the various forms of the
child’s activity, to get some insight into the nature of
the child himself”&mdash;“to get at the meaning of child-life
in terms of itself.”</p>

<p>Every reader of “The Education of Man” will
remember how Froebel uses his own boyish reminiscences
to help others to understand childish actions
often utterly misunderstood. In his paper on “Movement
Plays” he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In that nurture of childhood which is intended
to assist development, it is by no means sufficient
to supply play-material in proportion merely to the
stage of development already outwardly manifest.
It is at the same time of the utmost importance to
trace out the inner process of development and to
satisfy its demands.… In the nurture, development,
and education of the child, and especially in
the attempt to employ him, his own nature, his own
life and energy must be the main consideration.
The knowledge of isolated and external phenomena
may occasionally be a guide-post pointing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
direction, but it can never be a path leading to the
specific aim of child culture and education; for
<em>the condition of education is none other than comprehension
of the whole nature and essence of humanity
as manifested in the child</em>.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 239.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Just as Mr. Irving King, writing in 1904, says that
we must take as our starting-point the child’s bodily
activities, so did Froebel too declare, that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present time makes upon the educator
the wholly indispensable requirement&mdash;to comprehend
the earliest activity, the first action of
the child.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 16.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To this first action, Froebel devotes a whole paper,
“Das erste Kindesthun,” the opening sentence of which
contains the words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the new-born child, like a ripe grain of
corn, bears life within itself which will be developed
progressively and spontaneously, though in close
connection with life in general, so activity and
action are the first manifestations of awakening
child-life.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 23.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Writing in 1847, Froebel says that “decision, zeal,
and perseverance” must be brought to bear upon his
plan, in order that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(<i>a</i>) More careful observation of the child, his
relationships and his line of development, may
become general amongst us; and thereby</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) A better grounded insight be obtained into
the child’s being, mental and physical, and the
general collective conditions of his life.…
Deeper insight will be gained into the meaning and
importance of the child’s actions and outward
manifestations.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 248.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>This quotation is important as showing that Froebel
was deliberately looking for “<em>a line of development</em>,”
that he might better understand “the child’s being,
mental and physical.” Considering that Froebel wrote
between 1826 and 1850, the important points on which
he may be said to have successfully anticipated modern
psychology are, his recognition that the mind is what
he calls “a tri-unity” of action, feeling, and thought;
his treatment of early mental activity and his definition
of will; his conception of the earliest consciousness
as an undifferentiated whole; his recognition of the
importance of action not only in the realm of perception,
but also in that of feeling; and his surprisingly
complete account of instinct. Such anticipations are
due to the fact that the idea of development then
new to the scientific world possessed his very soul.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Humanity, <em>which lives only in its continuous
development</em> and cultivation, seems to us dead and
stationary, something to be modelled over again
and again in accordance with its present type.
We are ignorant of our own nature and the nature
of humanity.…”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 146.</cite></p>

<p>“God neither ingrafts nor inoculates. He
<em>develops</em> the most trivial and imperfect things in
continuously ascending series and in accordance
with eternal self-grounded and self-developing laws.
And God-likeness is and ought to be man’s highest
aim in thought and deed.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 328.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Justice has already been done to Froebel’s philosophy
by Dr. John Angus MacVannel, who says in his
closing paragraph:</p>

<p>“Froebel’s system has that unmistakable mark of
greatness about it that makes it worth our faithful effort
to understand it, and turn its conclusions to our advantage.…<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
His philosophy of education taken as a whole
seems, perhaps, the most satisfactory we have yet had.
One cannot but believe, however, that the candid reader
will at times find conclusions in his writings sustained
by reasonings, that are inadequately developed and
important questions by no means satisfactorily answered.…
On the other hand we must not forget that it is
insight, rather than exactitude, that is the life of a
philosophy; herein lies the secret of Froebel’s lasting
influence and power.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap">Froebel’s Analysis of Mind</span></h2>

<p>It is probably due to the emphasis which Froebel laid
upon the careful observation and equally careful
interpretation of the very earliest manifestations of
mental activity, that his views as to mental analysis
approach so closely to more modern ideas. His psychology
cannot possibly be dismissed as “faculty
psychology” in which the mind of a child is regarded as
a smaller and weaker replica of the mind of an adult.
The older psychologies, Professor Stout points out, are
based chiefly, if not entirely, on introspection alone,
while Froebel, as we have already seen, demanded
close observation of children in general, and of “each
separate child,” as well as consideration of mental
development in the race, in addition to introspection.</p>

<p>This “too exclusive reliance upon introspection” to
which Professor Stout refers as “the fundamental error”
of the faculty psychology, caused the older writers to
infer that just as a child is possessed of legs, arms and
hands, smaller and weaker, but otherwise apparently the
same as those of an adult, even so did he possess mental
“faculties,” such as memory and imagination, which,
like the little legs and arms, only required exercise in
order to grow strong. “It never occurred to them,”
writes Professor Stout, “that the powers of understanding,
willing, imagining, etc., instead of existing at
the outset, might have arisen as the result of a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
series of changes, each of which paved the way for the
next.” It did more than “<em>occur</em>” to Froebel, it was a
cardinal point with him. Professor Stout points out that
the idea of development is essential to mental science,
and Froebel was a biologist actually studying development,
before he became a psychologist. He came to the
study of mind prepared to find just such a series of
changes.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In speaking of evolution in general, he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Each successive stage of development does not
exclude the preceding, but takes it up into itself,
ennobled, uplifted, perfected.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 198.</cite></p>

<p>He speaks of:</p>

<p>“the master thought, the fundamental idea of our
time, that is, the education and development of
mankind.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 149.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And in his “Education of Man,” in a long and eloquent
passage on the need for continuity of training from the
tiniest of beginnings, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is highly pernicious and even destructive
to consider the stages of human development as
distinct, and not as life shows them, continuous in
themselves, in unbroken transitions.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 27.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The analysis of mind which Froebel recognizes, is
the still commonly accepted “tri-partite,” but he never
fails to refer to this as a unity or a tri-unity. Indeed,
his constant harping upon this string becomes almost
wearisome, in spite of the ingenuity with which he
continually varies his terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The early phenomenon of child-life, of human
existence in childhood, is an activity, one with
feeling and perception (Wahrnehmen).”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 23.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the nature of man shows itself early in
the life of the child, as feeling, acting and representing,
thinking and perceiving, and that in this
tri-unity is included the whole of his life utterance
and activity, we have said repeatedly, and it lies
open for any one to notice.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 122.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Disguised as Love, Life, and Light, this trinity is
made the connection of man, on the one side with
Nature, on the other side with God. God&mdash;who is Life,
Love, and Light, the All&mdash;shows Himself in Nature, in
the universe as life (energy), in humanity as love, and
in wisdom or in the spirit as light. Energy or life
man shares with Nature; by love he is united with
humanity; and by light or wisdom he is at one
with God.</p>

<p>For his “gift plays” Froebel claims that they “take
hold of the child in the tri-unity of his nature”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As now each of the single plays separately
considered takes hold of the child early, in the
tri-unity of his nature, as doing, feeling, and thinking,
so yet more do the employments as a whole.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 56.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And a forcible passage runs:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Only if the child is treated through fostering
his instinct for activity in the tri-unity of his nature,
as living, loving, and perceiving, in the unity of his
life, only thus can he develop as that which he is,
the manifold and organized, but in himself single,
whole.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 12.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This development of the threefold yet single nature
constitutes the “harmonious development,” reiterated
<i lang="la">ad nauseam</i> and without explanation, in Kindergarten
text-books. It is also the key to much that seems to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
useless detail as to the toys and games of early childhood.
The mother is told that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is of the highest importance for the nurse
to consider the earliest and slightest traces of the
organization (Gliederung) within itself of the child’s
mind as bodily, emotional and intellectual, that in
his development from mere existence to perception
and thought, none of these directions of his nature
should be fostered at the expense of the other …
the real foundation, the starting-point of human
development is the heart and the emotions, but
cultivation of action and thought (die Ausbildung
zur That und zum Denken) must go side by side
with it, constantly and inseparably: and thought
must form itself into action, and action resolve
and clear itself into thought; but both have their
roots in the emotional nature.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;<cite>P., p. 42.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The first part of the following quotation from a
letter written in 1851 towards the close of Froebel’s
life might almost be taken from a text-book of the
present day:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We find also three attitudes, spheres of work,
and regions of mind in man:</p>

<p>“(1) the region of the soul, the heart, Feeling;</p>

<p>“(2) the region of the mind, the head, Intellect;</p>

<p>“(3) the region of the active life, the putting
forth to actual deed, Will.</p>

<p>“As mental attitudes these three divisions seem
the wider apart the more we contemplate them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as spheres of work and regions of mind they seem
quite separate and perfect opposites. But the
highest and most absolute opposition is that which
most needs, and necessitates reconciliation; complete
opposites condition their uniting link. The
need for the uniting link appears in almost every
circumstance of life.… To satisfy that need is the
most imperative need now set before the human
race, … you will realize that the strengthening
of character which we all agree to be a necessity
of the age, is to be gained not only by stimulating
and elevating the soul and the emotions, but
by raising the whole mind, by training the intellect
and the will.… Then the heart would
acknowledge and esteem the intellectual power,
just as the intellect already recognizes feeling
as that which gives true warmth to our lives;
and life as a whole would make manifest the
soul which quickens existence, and gives it a
meaning, as well as the intellect which gives it
precision and culture. <em>Intellect</em>, <em>feeling</em> and <em>will</em>
would then unite, <em>a many-sided power</em>, to build
up and constitute our life. In the room of the
unstable character which must result from the
mere cultivation of the one department of emotion;
in the room of the doubt, or, I might
say empty negation, which too often proceeds
from the mere cultivation of the intellect; in
the room of the materialism, animalism, and sensuality
which must come from the mere attention
to the body, and physical side of our nature; we
should then have the harmonious development of
every side of our nature alike, we should then be
able to build up a life which would be everywhere
in touch with God, with physical nature, with
humanity at large.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 300.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In his article in the Encyclopædia Britannica,
Dr. Ward says, that in taking up the question of what
we exactly mean by <em>thinking</em>, “we are really passing
one of the hardest and fastest lines of the old psychology&mdash;that
between sense and understanding. So long as
it was the fashion to assume a multiplicity of faculties
the need was less felt for a clear exposition of their
connection. A man had senses and intellect much as
he had eyes and ears; the heterogeneity in the one
case was no more puzzling than in the other.”</p>

<p>In this connection it can again be shown that Froebel
was in advance of the old psychologists. In the first
of the two games in the Mother-Play book dealing with
sense-training&mdash;two out of forty-nine, the remainder
dealing chiefly with action&mdash;he makes it very clear that
he draws no hard and fast line between sense and
understanding. He tells the mother that Nature
speaks to the child through the senses, which act as
gateways to the world within, but that light comes
from the mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Durch die Sinne, schliesst sich auf des Innern Thor</div>
<div class="verse">Doch der Geist ist’s der dies zieht ans Licht hervor.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when he says that the baby in the cradle should
not be left unoccupied if it wakes, he uses a pronoun in
the singular in referring to “the activity of sense and
mind.” He suggests hanging a cage containing a lively
bird in the child’s line of vision and adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This attracts the activity of the child’s
senses and mind and gives <em>it</em> nourishment in many
ways.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;<cite>E., p. 49.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The faculty psychology and the formal discipline
theory that came from it, says Professor Horne, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
admit the possibility of training one faculty, e.g. perception,
by training another, e.g. reason, “it was not
the mind that was trained, but its faculties.”</p>

<p>It is, however, of the merest infant that Froebel
uses such expressions as “the awakening power of
thought,” “the tenderest growth of mind,” and tells
the mother that he “shows trace of thought, and can
draw conclusions.” The ball is given to the baby to
help him “to find himself in the midst of his perceptive,
operative, and his comparing (thinking) activity.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 55.</cite> Long years before this he had written of
the teaching of drawing, “this instruction addresses
itself to the senses, and through them to the power
of thought.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 294.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He who does not perceive traces of the future
development of the child, who does not foster these
with self-consciousness and wisdom, when they lie
hidden in the depths and in the night, will not
see them clearly, will not nourish them suitably,
at least, not sufficiently, when they lie open before
him.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 58.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Instead of ready-made faculties Froebel recognizes
possibilities, conditions, which will remain possibilities
if the necessary stimulus is not forthcoming, for in
noting how the mother talks to her infant, though she
is obliged to confess that there can be no understanding
of her words, he says the mother’s instinctive action
is right:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“for that which will one day develop, and which
must originate, begins and must begin when as
yet nothing exists but the conditions, the possibility.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 40.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsewhere he asks:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is it to be supposed that in the child the
capacity for becoming a complete human being
is contained less than in the acorn is contained
the capacity to become a strong, vigorous and
complete oak?”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 62.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And he speaks of how the mother appeals to the
infant as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“understanding, perceptive and capable, for where
there is not the germ of something, that something
can never be called forth and appear.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 31.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is true that in the same passage in which he
speaks of “the tenderest growth of mind,” he
does speak of mental powers (Geisteskräfte), as indeed
every one does, but a few lines above he has spoken
of “the cultivation of the mental power of the child
in different directions.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Besides, the mental powers to
which he here alludes, and which are to be awakened
and fostered in the infant, are the powers “to compare,
to infer, to judge, to think.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 57.</cite> Here,
too, Froebel gives a description of what he means by
memory, and it is clearly not a separate faculty considered
apart from another faculty, viz. imagination:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The plays carried on with the ball awaken
and exercise the power of the child’s mind to place
again before himself mentally a vanished object,
to see it mentally even when the outer perception
is gone; these games awaken and practise the
power of re-presenting, of remembering, of holding
fast in remembrance an object formerly present,
of again thinking of it; that is, they foster the
memory.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 57.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>So even the infant is to think, and the progress is
well described in the Mother Plays as</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“from experience of a thing, joined with thought
about it, up to pure thought.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 121.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In a lecture<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> given many years ago, Dr. Ward
sought to drive home to teachers the futility of this
hard and fast line between sense training and training
to think. And there are some interesting parallels
between Dr. Ward’s metaphors here and Froebel’s
writing in “The Education of Man.” Dr. Ward said:</p>

<p>“Training of the senses, as it is not very happily
called, is, if it is anything, so much intellectual exercise.…
And nothing can be more absurd than to suppose
it is not necessary.… By a judicious training in
observation you begin to make a child think when it
is five years old.… If a child is to think to any
purpose, he must think as he goes on; as soon as the
material he has gathered begins to oppress him he
must think it into shape, or it will tend to smother
intellectual life at its dawn, as a bee is drowned in
its own honey, for want of cells in which to store it.”</p>

<p>It is in describing how the little child collects pebbles,
twigs, leaves, etc., that Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child loves all things that enter his small
horizon and extend his little world. To him the
least thing is a new discovery; but it must not
come dead into the little world, nor lie dead
therein, lest it obscure the small horizon and
crush the little world.… It is the longing for
interpretation that urges the child to appeal to
us … the intense desire for this that urges
him to bring his treasures to us and lay them
in our laps.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 73.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The help we are told to give at first is merely to
supply the child with a name, for “through the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the form is retained in memory and defined in thought.”
Later the mother is told to provide “encouragement
and help, that the child may weave into a whole what
he has found scattered and parted.” As a type of the
help considered necessary we have:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Mother, are the pigeons and hens birds, for
the pigeons live in pigeon-houses and the chickens
don’t fly?’ ‘Have they no feathers, child; have
they no wings? Haven’t they two legs like all
birds?’ ‘Are the bees and butterflies and beetles
birds, too: for they have wings and fly much higher.…’
‘Look, they have no feathers, they build no
nests.’”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 56.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In another passage Froebel calls it not only advisable
but necessary that the parents, without being
pedantic or over-anxious, should connect the child’s
doings with language, because this “increases knowledge,
and awakens that judgment and reflection (die
Urtheilskraft und das Nachdenken), to which man, left
to Nature, does not attain sufficiently early.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 79.</cite></p>

<p>Giving names, and helping in classification is
surely a sufficient parallel to Dr. Ward’s “thinking the
material into shape,” and just as the latter says that
by such training you can “make a child think” when
it is five years old, so Froebel in his chapter on “Man
in Earliest Childhood” makes his ideal father “sum
up his rule of conduct in a few words,” declaring that:
“To lead children early to think, this I consider the
first and foremost object of child-training.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 87.</cite></p>

<p>Froebel’s theories, then, cannot be dismissed as
based on “faculty psychology,” since it seems clear
that wherever he found them his views on mental
analysis were very similar to those now generally
accepted. It is more remarkable, however, that he
should have modern views about Conation and Will.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smcap">Will and its Early Manifestations</span></h2>

<p>It is open to doubt whether any modern psychologist
has yet given a better definition of fully developed
Will than that given by Froebel eighty-seven years
ago:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will is the mental activity of man ever
consciously proceeding from a definite point, in a
definite direction, to a definite conscious end and
aim, in harmony with the whole nature of
humanity.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 96.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>With this definition compare what Professor Stout
has to say:</p>

<p>“In its most complex developments, mental activity
takes the form of self-conscious and deliberate volition,
in which the starting-point is the idea of an end to be
attained, and the desire to attain it; and the goal is
the realization of this end, by the production of a long
series of changes in the external world … it belongs
to the essence of will, not merely to be directed towards
an end, but to ideally anticipate this and consciously
aim at it.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Between these two definitions the difference is in
the omission in Froebel’s definition of any mention of
desire, and this is supplied a little later, when, having
stated that “by school here is meant neither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
schoolroom, nor school-keeping, but the conscious
communication of knowledge for a definite purpose,
and in definite connection,” he ends up with:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By this knowledge, instruction and the school
are to lead man <em>from desire to will</em>, from activity
of will to firmness of will, and thus continually
advancing, to the attainment of his destiny, of his
earthly perfection.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 139.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Now Professor Stout’s whole psychology is founded
on his conception of mental activity. Towards the end
of his second volume he says: “The reader is already
familiar with my general doctrine. It has pervaded the
whole treatment of psychological topics in this work.
The aim of the present chapter is to present it in a more
systematic form, and to guard it against objections.
Our starting-point lies in the conception of mental
activity as the direction of mental process towards
an end.”</p>

<p>It is distinctly significant, therefore, to find how
closely Froebel’s ideas on the subject resemble Professor
Stout’s conception of mental activity.</p>

<p>“Conscious process,” writes Professor Stout, “is
in every moment directed towards an end, whether
this end be distinctly or vaguely recognized by the
conscious subject, or not recognized at all.”</p>

<p>Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In all activity, in every deed of man, even as
a child, yes the very smallest, an aim is expressed,
a reference to something, to the furthering or
representing of something; … thus the child
strives, even if unconsciously, to make his inner
life objective, and through that perceptible, that
so he may become conscious of it.”&mdash;<cite>P., pp.
237-240.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The same idea, that conscious process is directed
to an end, though there may be no consciousness of
that end, is given in another passage, where Froebel
is speaking of the need for satisfying a child’s normal
desire for playthings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Very often the child seeks for something,
nevertheless he himself does not know at all what
he seeks; at another time he puts something away
from him and again knows not why.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 168.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Of the earliest mental activity Professor Stout
writes:</p>

<p>“In its earliest and simplest form, mental activity
consists in those simple reactions which without being
determined by any definite idea of an end to be realized,
tend on the whole to the maintenance of immediate
pleasure and the avoidance of immediate pain.”</p>

<p>The movements of the organism at this earliest
stage “seem primarily adapted to the conservation
and furtherance of vital process in general.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Froebel speaks of the child’s efforts:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“to put far from him that which is opposed to the
needs of his life and yet would break in upon it.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 167.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>He tells the mother that, in the first stages at least,
the restlessness and tears of the infant will warn her of
the presence of anything in his surroundings hurtful to
his development, while his laughter and movements of
pleasure will show “what according to the feeling of
the child is suited to the undisturbed development of
his life as an immature human being.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stout goes on to say that such simple reactions
are adapted “secondarily and by way of necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
corollary to the conservation and furtherance of
conscious life.” He tells us that: “The primary
craving with which the education of the senses begins,
so far as it does not involve such practical needs as that
of food, may be described as a general craving for
stimulation or excitement … this conation being in
the first instance in the highest degree indeterminate.”</p>

<p>Froebel, who speaks of the nurse “soothing the
restless child <em>vaguely striving</em> for definite and satisfactory
outward activity,” tells us that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“if his bodily needs are satisfied and he feels
himself well and strong, the first spontaneous
employment of the child is spontaneous taking in
(selbstthätiges Aufnehmen) of the outer world.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 29.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>He writes to Madame Schmidt, the cousin for whose
assistance he has begged in observing children:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This spontaneous activity of limb and vividness
of sensation natural to infancy, and I may
say inseparable from it, must also be carefully
studied.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 110.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And, in the Mother Songs, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You can see how his bodily activity, the
movement and use of his limbs, like the activity
of his senses, all turn towards one point: Life
must be grasped, experienced and perceived …
he wants to appropriate the outer and to re-embody
it … his susceptibility for all that gives
and takes up life will strike you as something
that elevates his life in every way; even as young
plants and animals are susceptible to the faintest
workings of light and warmth, or the impressions
of their environment, however delicate. Moreover,
this receptivity is most closely related to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
great general excitability and sensibility (Erregbarkeit,
Reizbarkeit).”&mdash;<cite>M., pp. 119-121.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel’s views as to the nature both of early and
of later mental activity then bear a strong resemblance
to the modern view as stated by Professor Stout.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>In searching Froebel’s writings to find what he has
to say about the stages lying between early mental
activity and fully developed will, between what he calls
“natural activity of the will, and true genuine firmness
of will,” it soon becomes clear that it is impossible to
separate what is said about will development, from
what is said about intellectual development.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> This is
a natural consequence of Froebel’s constant insistence
on the unity of consciousness, and it is the position of
modern psychology, whether written from the analytic
or the genetic point of view. Mr. Irving King writes:
“The functional point of view emphasizes first of all
the intimate inter-relation of all forms of mental
activity and the impossibility of describing any one
aspect of consciousness except with reference to consciousness
as a whole.” Professor Stout, in his
“Analytic Psychology,” has a section entitled “Conation
and Cognition developed co-incidentally,”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> while
Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thought must form itself in action, and
action resolve and clear itself in thought.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 42.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel speaks of his projected institution at Helba
as “fundamental,”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“inasmuch as in training and instruction it will rest
on the foundation from which proceed all genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
knowledge and all genuine practical attainments;
it will rest on life itself and on creative efforts,
<em>on the union and interdependence of doing and
thinking</em>, representation and knowledge, art and
science. The institution will base its work on the
pupil’s personal efforts in work and expression,
making these, again, the foundation of all genuine
knowledge and culture. Joined with thoughtfulness,
these efforts become a direct medium of
culture.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 38.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor Stout’s account of how the unconscious
mental activity of early childhood becomes transformed
into the definite and conscious activity of fully developed
will is, stated briefly, something to this effect. It is of
the essence of conation to seek its own satisfaction, and
this is only possible as the conation becomes definite.
“Blind craving gives place to open-eyed desire,” as the
original conation tends to define itself. So “the gradual
acquisition of knowledge through experience is but
another expression for the process whereby the originally
blind craving becomes more distinct and more differentiated.”
The grouping of cognitions is not produced
by the conscious needs: “It is the way in which
the conation itself grows and develops.”</p>

<p>For this account we can find a wonderfully exact
parallel in one of Froebel’s less well-known papers, that
on “Movement Plays.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All outer activity of the child has its ultimate
and distinctive foundation in his inmost nature and
life. The deepest craving of this inner activity
is to behold itself mirrored in some outward object.
In and through such representation, the child
himself grasps and perceives the nature, direction
and aim of his own activity, and learns also further
to regulate and determine his life, that is his activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
according to these outward phenomena.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 238.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This craving for outward representation, by satisfaction
of which the child gains knowledge of the ends of
his activity, is an exact equivalent of Stout’s blind
craving which gives place to open-eyed desire as it
tends to define itself. Froebel’s conclusion, that only as
this unconscious or blind craving for action is satisfied
does the child become “conscious of the nature, direction
and ends of his own activity,” is but another way of
stating Professor Stout’s conclusion, that the grouping
of cognitions, which is the gradual acquirement of
knowledge through experience, is “the way in which
the conation itself grows and develops.” So, cognition
and conation are developed simultaneously, or, to repeat
Froebel’s own phrase, “Thought forms itself in action,
and action resolves and clears itself in thought.”</p>

<p>Professor Stout goes on to say that in this defining
process one conation springs out of another, whereby
as one conation is satisfied and so comes to an end,
another becomes in its turn the end of activity. He takes
as illustration the child learning to walk, saying, “The
mental attitude of the child learning to walk is one of
conscious endeavour. When he has become habituated
to the act, he performs it without attending to his
movements, his mind being fixed on the attainment
of other ends.” Froebel proceeds in the same way,
using the very same example. He has already said
that at first the child:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“cares for the use of his body, his senses and limbs,
merely for the sake of their use and practice, but
not for the sake of the results of this use. He
is wholly indifferent to this; <em>or, rather, he has as
yet no idea whatever of this</em>.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 48.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, in the paper on movement, he goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Each sure and independent movement gives
the child pleasure, because of the feeling of power
which it arouses in him. Even simple walking produces
this effect, for it gives the child a threefold
feeling, a threefold consciousness: First, the consciousness
that he <em>moves</em> himself; secondly, that
he moves himself from one place to another;
third, that through this movement he attains or
reaches something.… It is a well-established fact
that his first walking gives the child pleasure as an
expression of his power. <em>To this pleasure, however,
are soon added the two joy-bringing perceptions of
coming to something, and of being able to attain
something.</em> These several perceptions should all be
fostered at the same time … he should get his
limbs, and indeed his whole body, into his own
power. He should learn to use his bodily strength
and the activity of his limbs for definite purposes.…
<em>The effort to reach a particular object may have
its source in the child’s desire to hold himself firm and
upright by it, but we also observe that it gives him
pleasure to be actually near the object, to touch it,
to feel it, to grasp it, and perhaps also&mdash;which is a
new phase of activity&mdash;to be able to move it.</em> Hence
we see that the child when he has reached the
desired object, hops up and down before it, and
beats on it with his little arms and hands, in order,
as it were, to assure himself of the reality of the
object and to notice its qualities. It is well, <em>while
the child is making these experiments</em>, to name the
object and its parts. <em>The object of giving these
names is not primarily the development of the child’s
power of speech, but to assist his comprehension of
the object</em>, its parts and its properties, <em>by defining
his sense-impressions</em>.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 241.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Another passage runs:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present effort of mankind is an endeavour
after freer self-development.… Therefore the
more or less clear aim of the individual is to attain
to clearness about himself and about life, to comprehension
and right use of life, to both insight and
accomplishment.… Therefore the educator must
understand the earliest activity and encourage the
impulse to self-culture, through independent doing,
observing and experimenting.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 16.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To say that a conation tends to define itself is only
to say that unconscious ends tend to be replaced by
conscious ends, and we have seen that both Froebel and
Professor Stout give unconsciousness or consciousness
of the end, as the difference between earlier and later
forms of mental activity. Professor Stout’s conclusion
is that “apart from the perpetual germination of one
conation out of another, the characteristic features of
the mental life of human beings would be inexplicable.”</p>

<p>Now, to be conscious of one’s ends or aims is, in a
certain sense, to be self-conscious, so the transition from
earlier to later forms of mental activity is practically
the development of self-consciousness. It is interesting,
therefore, to see that just as Professor Stout gives as
his explanation of human life, the perpetual germination
of one conation out of another, so Froebel gives as his
explanation, his meaning of life, the gradual development
of self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness, involving true volition, or self-determination,
is to Froebel “the end of man, for
which he first was planned.” It is, as he constantly
put it, man’s “destination.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To become clearly conscious of all the conditions
and relations in which and by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which man exists makes man first become man in
consciousness and in action.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 12.</cite></p>

<p>“For man is destined for consciousness, for
freedom, for self-determination.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 136.</cite></p>

<p>“Self-consciousness belongs to the nature of
man, is one with it; to become conscious of itself
is the first task in the life of the child as a
human being, as it is the task of his whole life.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 40.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>“Who amongst us,” exclaims Professor Royce,
“conceives himself in his uniqueness except as the
remote goal of some ideal process of coming to himself
and of awakening to the truth about his own life?
Only an infinite process can show me who I am.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Froebel never loses sight of this. In his Autobiography
he tells how he began “unwillingly” to
write something in the album of a friend who was
the owner of a beautiful farm, and he concludes:
“Then my thoughts grew clear and I continued,
‘Thou givest man bread; let my aim be to give man
himself.’” That he verily believed that the gradual
development of self-consciousness is the first task in
the life of the child is abundantly evident. In the
very beginning of his Mother Songs he tells the mother
to give her child something to push against, “to bring
the child to self-knowledge as soon as possible,” and
at the end he says, “When a child or human being
has found himself and has firm hold over himself, he
is ready to walk joyfully through life.”</p>

<p>In “The First Action of a Child,” Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The nature of man, as man, is that he is
self-conscious, and this is stamped with distinctness
enough to be observed in the quite peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
character of childish activity,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in his impulse to
busy himself self-actively, spontaneously: an
impulse which awakens simultaneously with mind,
and which is in harmony with feeling and perception.
If this tendency to spontaneous activity
is fostered, man’s triune nature&mdash;energy, emotion
and intellect&mdash;is satisfied.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 21.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>A realization of what Sir Oliver Lodge calls “the
universal struggle for self-manifestation and corporeal
realization, which plays so large a part in all activity,”
underlies all that Froebel has to say of the progress
from unconscious activity to self-conscious volition.
His view of the Universe is exactly that tentatively
suggested by Professor Lodge, viz. that something akin
to this universal struggle “is exhibited in a region
beyond and above what is ordinarily conceived of
as ‘Nature.’ The process of evolution can be regarded
as the gradual unfolding of the Divine Thought or
Logos, throughout the universe, by the action of Spirit
upon matter.”</p>

<p>This takes us out of the region of psychology, but
Froebel’s subject was not psychology, <i lang="la">per se</i>, but child
development, as a part of the whole plan of evolution,
man being the most highly developed of creatures.</p>

<p>The whole universe is an expression of the Divine,
but man alone can become conscious of his origin.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All things are destined to reveal God in their
external and transient being.… It is the special
destiny of man, as an intelligent and rational being
to become conscious of his divine essence and to
render this active, to reveal it in his life, with self-determination
and freedom.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 2.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Made in the image of God,” meant to Froebel
self-conscious and self-determined. The relation of man
to God is expressed by Froebel as the relation of the
thought to the thinker “<em>could the thought but become
conscious of itself</em>.” In a letter of 1843, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the basis of the Kindergarten lies an idea
which serves alike for all the interstellar spaces,
for all systems of the sun; the fulfilment of the
divine will and the manifestation of the same.
<em>In order to become such a manifestation of the divine,
man has first to attain the basis of self-consciousness</em>;
to which end serves the early culture of the spirit
of humanity in the world of childhood.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 133.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In a paper entitled “A Second Review of the Plays,”
which really deals chiefly with evolution, we read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We must see clearly the conditions of development
in Nature and then employ them in life.
Thus only can we raise man upon his own plane,
that is, the spiritual plane, at least to such a
degree of perfection as is shown on their plane
by the types of Nature.</p>

<p>“Man&mdash;the all-surveying&mdash;must develop himself
by gradual growth of consciousness, must raise
himself eventually to clear consciousness of the
foundation, conditions and goal of his life.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 198.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It was as clear to Froebel as to Professor Lloyd
Morgan that the lower animals are kept from
reaching self-consciousness by the definiteness of their
instincts,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but to Froebel as to Browning “in completed
Man begins anew a tendency to God.” Like
Browning again, Froebel finds that man has “somewhat
to cast off, somewhat to become,” he, too, “finds
Progress man’s distinctive mark alone, not God’s, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
not the beasts’; God is, they are, man partly is,
and wholly hopes to be.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Man in his first period of life on earth is to be
regarded while a child in three separate relations,
which are united in themselves.</p>

<p>“(<i>a</i>) As a child of Nature, that is according to
his earthly and natural conditions and connections,
and in this relation bound, chained, unconscious,
subject to impulses (als ein gebundenes, gefesseltes,
unbewusstes, den Trieben unterworfenes).</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) As a child of God, and in this relation as
a free being, destined to self-consciousness.</p>

<p>“(<i>c</i>) As a child of Humanity, and in this relation,
as a being struggling from bondage toward
freedom, toward consciousness.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 11.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And the beginning of all he finds in “The First
Action of the Child.” In the paper to which he gives
this title Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Helplessness and personal will, a mind of
one’s own, soon become therefore the turning-points
of child-life, the fulcrum of which is free
spontaneous activity, self-employment.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 27.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is because Froebel believes this, that we hear
so much of creative activity. Consciousness, which
Meredith calls “the great result of mortal suffering,”
is the outcome of all the unconscious striving.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child, although unconsciously, strives to
make his life outwardly objective, and thus perceptible
and so to become conscious of it.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 240.</cite></p>

<p>“Man only comes to the power of self-examination
and self-knowledge in any relation whatever
with the greatest difficulty, and must first learn to
study himself … in the mirror of Nature and of
all creation.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 57.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child must perceive and grasp his own
life in an objective manifestation before he can
perceive and grasp it in himself. Such mirroring
of the inner life, such making of the inner life
objective, is essential, for through it, the child
comes to self-consciousness and learns to order,
determine and master himself.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 238.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel realizes then, that true volition is the outcome
of unconscious striving, that it can only come
through action, and, what is most important, through
action which is the outcome of feeling, “worthy his
effort.” So, while stating that the formation of “a
pure, strong and enduring will” is the main object of
education, he takes care to point out that unless the
boy is allowed to carry out in action “that which is
within,” ideas which have appealed to him, and which
he has already made his own, that main object will
not be easily attainable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To raise activity of will to firmness of will,
and so to arouse, and form a pure, strong and
enduring will, for the representation of a characteristic
humanity, is the chief aim, the main
object of the school.… The starting-point of
all mental activity in the boy should be energetic
and healthy, the direction should be simple and
definite, the aim certain and conscious, and
worthy of his effort. Therefore to raise the
natural activity of the will to true genuine firmness
of will, all the boy’s activities should have
reference to the development and accomplishment
of what is within him. Activity of will proceeds
from activity of the feelings, and firmness of will
from firmness of the feelings, and where the
first is lacking, the second will be difficult of
attainment.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 96.</cite></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">Characteristics of the Earliest Consciousness</span></h2>

<p>It is in the emphasis he lays upon the mental activity
of the child from the very first, that Froebel
approaches so closely to the position of the modern
psychologist, and in his account of the earliest consciousness
he distinctly resembles Professors Ward and
Stout.</p>

<p>Only to “some of our most distinguished modern
psychologists” does Professor Stout attribute a strong
disposition to recognize in the elementary processes of
perception and association, the rudimentary presence
of these mental operations which in their higher form
we call reasoning and constructive imagination.</p>

<p>Now Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One can recognize and watch, even in the first
stages of childhood, though only in their slightest
traces and tenderest germs, all the mental activities
which certainly do not stand out prominently till
later life. Say not, ye parents, How can such
tendencies lie already in the life of the child still so
unconscious and so helpless? If they did not lie
in it they could never be developed from it … for
where there is not the germ of something, this
something will never be called forth and appear.…
As man is a being intended for increasing self-consciousness,
so shall he also become an inferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and judging being (schliessendes und urtheilendes).
Man has also a quite characteristic power of
imagination, and&mdash;what must never be forgotten,
but continually kept before the eyes as important
and guiding&mdash;the new-born child not only will
become man, but the man with all his qualities,
and with the unity of his being, already appears
and indeed is in the child.”&mdash;<cite>P., pp. 30-49.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Psychologists in general, says Professor Stout,
show a tendency, which he regards as erroneous, “to
ignore the constructive aspect of early mental process,
to recognize mental productiveness only in complete
and advanced stages of mental development.”</p>

<p>But Froebel, in speaking of the mother’s play with
a mere infant, when the coloured ball may present “the
perception of an object as such,” most distinctly states
that the child’s “first impressions, as it were the first
cognitions,” come to him in these early plays by
<em>means of his own activity</em>, an activity of body
emphatically, as we shall see presently, but an activity
also of mind, of perception, “durch Wahrnehmen …
durch dunkles Auffassen … durch Selbst-thätigkeit.”<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Froebel uses such expressions as “the spontaneous
reception” and even “the critical reception of the
outer world,” just as Dr. Ward, in refusing to recognize
an internal sense, says “the new facts … are due to
our mental activity, and not to a special mode of what
has been called our sensitivity.”</p>

<p>The active, rather than the passive attitude, strikes
Froebel so forcibly that he calls the two modes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
consciousness, the receiving of, and reacting upon
impressions, a “double expression.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first voluntary needs of the child, if its
bodily needs are satisfied and it feels well and
strong, are observation of its surroundings, spontaneous
reception of the outer world (selbstthätiges
Aufnehmen der Aussenwelt) and play, which is
spontaneous expression, or acting out of what is
within. This double expression (Diese Doppeläusserung)
of taking in and expressing outwardly is
necessarily grounded in its nature, as in human
nature in general; since the child’s first earthly destiny
is to attain by critical reception (durch prüfende
Aufnahme) of the outer world into itself, by manifold
inward impressions and outward expressions of its
inner world, and by critical comparison of both,
to the recognition of their unity.…”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 29.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor Stout attributes this ignoring by certain
psychologists of the constructive aspect of early mental
process to a false view of the nature both of association
and of construction, the fundamental fallacy of the
associationists lying in their disposition to explain the
nature and existence of a whole by reference to the
nature and existence of the parts which are contained
in it, so that “the parts must be supposed to pre-exist
before they are combined, and to pre-exist in such a
way that they need only to be in some manner externally
brought together or associated in order to constitute
the whole which contains them.”</p>

<p>In like manner Dr. Ward accuses psychologists of
having “usually represented mental advance as consisting
fundamentally in the combination and recombination
of various elementary units, the so-called
sensations and primitive movements, or, in other
words, in a species of mental chemistry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>That Froebel seems to have avoided the error thus
pointed out by those two psychologists, is surprising
enough, but it is even more surprising to find that
this is probably due to the fact that his conception
of the earliest possible consciousness is very much
like theirs.</p>

<p>In rejecting “the atomistic view,” Professor Ward
maintains that “the further we go back, the nearer
we approach to a total presentation, having the
character of one general continuum in which differences
are latent.”</p>

<p>Froebel’s account, as given in “The Education of
Man,” is very similar:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Although in itself made up of the same
objects and of the same organization, the external
world comes to the child at first, out of its void,
as it were, in misty, formless indistinctness, in
chaotic confusion, even the child and the outer
world merge into one another.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 40.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This description reminds us of Professor James’
picturesque expression, “big, blooming, buzzing confusion,”
which is so often quoted, but which does not
really convey so true a picture as Dr. Ward’s account,
for where there is no distinction there can surely be
no confusion. But a few pages further on we find
Froebel describing the infant consciousness before
speech begins, as “<em>still an unorganized, undifferentiated
unity</em>” (noch eine ungegliederte mannigfaltigkeitslose
Einheit). This is identical with the expression used
by Professor Stout, who, in speaking of the stage to
which he gives the name “implicit apprehension,” the
apprehension of an unanalysed whole, uses the phrase
“distinctionless unity.” Froebel talks of the child
feeling himself a whole and “so also, though unconsciously,
seeking to grasp a whole, never merely a part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
as such.” And just as Dr. Ward claims for psychology
as well as for biology “what may be called a principle
of progressive differentiation or specialization,” so
Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child mind develops according to the
law which governs world development, viz.: that
of progression from the unlimited to the limited,
from the general to the special, from the whole
to the part.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 170.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In this, of course, lies the reason for Froebel’s
correct apprehension of the infant mind, he was
biologist first, and his mind was full of the idea of
development.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the same time there begins in the child,
as in the seed-corn, a development towards complexity.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 172.</cite></p>

<p>“Whether we are looking at a seed or an egg,
whether we are watching feeling or thought, what
is definite proceeds everywhere from what is indefinite
and this is the way in which your child’s
life is sure to show itself.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 121.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor Ward goes on to discuss what is implied
in this process of differentiation or mental growth,
saying that if analogies are to be taken from the
physical world at all, the growth of a seed or embryo,
will furnish far better illustrations of the unfolding of
the contents of consciousness than the building up of
molecules.</p>

<p>It was the endeavour, and quaint enough it seems
to us, to translate this psychological truth into educational
practice, that led Froebel to lay so much stress
on the fact that the earliest of his so-called “Gifts”
are indivisible wholes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us place ourselves at the nursery table,
and try to perceive what the child is impelled to
do in the beginning of his self-employment. Let
us sit ourselves as unnoticed as possible considering
how the child, after he has examined the self-contained
tangible object in its form and colour,
has moved it here and there and proved its solidity,
how he then tries to divide it, at least to change
its form.… Thus <em>after perception of the whole,
the child desires to see it separated</em> into parts.…
Let us stop at this significant phenomenon and
try to discern through it what plaything following
on the self-contained ball, hard and soft, and the
solid hard cube, we should for inner reason and
without arbitrariness give to the child.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 117.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Then come directions as to the manner in which
the toy is to be presented:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“in order to give the child <em>the impression of the
whole</em> (den Eindrück des Ganzen). <em>From this as
the first fundamental perception</em> (der ersten Grundanschauung)
<em>everything proceeds and must proceed</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Starting from the conception of an undifferentiated
totality or objective continuum, Dr. Ward says, “Of
the very beginnings of this continuum we can say
nothing, absolute beginnings are beyond the pale of
science. Actual presentation consists in this continuum
being differentiated; every differentiation constitutes
a new presentation. Hence the common-place of
psychologists: ‘We are only conscious as we are
conscious of change.’” …</p>

<p>As to absolute beginnings, Froebel too writes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
these are past finding out, but he does so in order to
call the mother’s attention to the importance of the
very earliest steps:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Do not say, It is much too early.… Too
early? Do you know when, where and how
your child’s intellectual development begins?
Can you tell when and where is the boundary
of existence that has not yet begun, and of its
actual beginning, and how this boundary manifests
itself?”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 154.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Coming now to what Froebel has to say as to how
his “unorganized unity” becomes differentiated, we
shall not find that his brief account differs in any
really fundamental way from that of Professor Ward.
Some of his expressions have a very modern sound,
such as: “how the outer world begins to divide and
analyse itself”; how “out of the indefinite outside
and around the child comes the definite”; or again
how the child gains “the three great perceptions of
object, space and time, which at first were one collective
perception.” (“Die drei grossen Wahrnehmungen
von Gegenstand, Raum und Zeit; welche anfangs in
einer Gesammtwahrnehmung in dem Kinde ruhten.”)&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 37.</cite></p>

<p>Commenting upon the phrase “We are only conscious
as we are conscious of change,” Dr. Ward remarks that
the word change does not sufficiently explain what
happens in differentiation, for this implies that the
increased complexity is due to the persistence of former
changes; such persistence being essential to the very
idea of growth or development.… At the same time
he is careful to point out that neither in “retentiveness”
nor in assimilation is there “any confronting of the old
with the new,” any “active comparison.” Without
change of impression consciousness would be a blank,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
but “a difference between presentations is not at all
the same as the presentation of that difference. The
former must precede the latter; the latter, which
requires active comparison, need not follow … we must
recognize objects before we can compare them.”</p>

<p>Froebel says that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All the development of the child has its
foundation in almost imperceptible attainments
and perceptions … the first perceptions, in the
beginning almost imperceptible and evanescent, are
fixed, increased and clarified by innumerable
repetitions, and <em>by change</em>.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 38.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel, too, goes back to this very earliest stage,
the stage when a baby “begins to notice.” He says that
this indication of an intellect (Seelenaeusserung) begins
when the child is a few weeks old, and is occasioned at
first by the movement, that is change in position, of a
bright object, “in and by means of the motion the child
first perceives the object.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 64.</cite></p>

<p>In another passage Froebel speaks of change as
“a dim conception of sequence, and thus of dim comparison.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These first impressions come to the child by
means of perception and seeing, and by means of
coming, staying and vanishing (of the ball); <em>by
means of change</em>, thus also, in a certain point of
view by means of early dim conceptions of sequence,
of foundation and result, of cause and effect, and
thus of dim comparison.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 65.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>A change or difference which does not imply active
comparison, and a change or sequence which does
imply dim comparison are not very far apart, and
Froebel makes his meaning clearer still by using the
words “unconsciously comparing” (unbewusst vergleichend).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By this play his attention is called to the
precise shape of the cube; and he will look at
it sharply, unconsciously comparing it with the
hand, to which his eyes were first attracted.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 84.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Nor does Froebel omit to notice the necessary close
connection of the new with the old, which Dr. Ward
emphasizes.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child very often seeks for something
without at all knowing what he seeks; in like
manner he repels something without at all knowing
why. Yet the child does not for this reason
turn away accidentally, neither does he seek the
accidental. Generally it is the new for which the
child seeks, but not a novelty which has no connection
with what has hitherto been, for that,
should it appear, would obstruct development.
He seeks the new which has developed from the
old, like a bud from a branch. He seeks a new
unexpected turn, a new unexpected use of a
thing, new unexpected properties, new and yet
unconsciously anticipated development, a new
unexpected connection with his life.… The
child indeed seeks for the new that is outside
of himself, but not on account of its externality.
Really he is seeking the new of which he feels
premonitions in himself, in his own development.
Since, however, he does not yet know this, and so
cannot give an account of it, <em>the child seeks especially
for change</em>, in order to gain a means of growing
up within himself, and of growing forth outwardly
from himself.</p>

<p>“Above all, therefore, it is the old within the
child which clarifies, unfolds and transmutes itself,
thus developing that which is new. The whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
process takes place according to a definite law
resting in the child himself, in his life, in life as
such.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 168.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that Froebel draws no hard and fast line
between sensation and thought. On more than one
occasion, he does refer to something less definite than a
perception, in one passage using the word “Eindrück,”
and in another the term “Vorentwickelung,” translated
by Miss Jarvis as “preliminary impression,” of which he
says it is “to be raised later, at the right time, by look
and by word, to a clear perception.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 86.</cite></p>

<p>In “The Education of Man,” Froebel’s earlier work,
he deals with the function of language, “the word,” in
differentiating “the misty formless darkness,” the
nothing, the mist.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At an early period there come, too, on the
part of the parents, corresponding words which
at first separate the child from the outer world,
but afterwards re-unite them. With the help of
these words, these objects present themselves, at
first singly and rarely, but later in various combinations
and more frequently in their self-contained
definite individuality. At last man&mdash;the child&mdash;beholds
himself as a definite individual object,
wholly distinct from all others.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 40.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The function of the name, as calling attention to the
thing, seemed to Froebel of so much consequence, that
he says, “the name creates the thing for the child.”
It is in connection with the development of speech in
the stage just following on infancy that he says: “Up
to this stage, the inner being of man is still an unorganized
undifferentiated unity. With language, organization
sets in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“This period is pre-eminently the period of the
development of the faculty of speech. Therefore it
was indispensable that whatever the child did
should be clearly and definitely designated by the
word. Every object, every thing, became such,
as it were only through the word; before it had
been named, although the child might have seemed
to see it with the outer eyes, it had no existence
for him. The name, as it were, created the thing
for the child.&mdash;<cite>E., p. 90.</cite></p>

<p>“The object of giving names is not primarily
the development of the child’s power of speech,
but to assist his comprehension of the object, its
parts and properties, by defining his sense-impressions.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 242.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor Stout also speaks of the casual naming
of the object, by those around the child as “a means
of fixing the attention of the child on the object
when it would otherwise pass unnoticed,” and he
guards against the misconception that the name at
the outset is a name for the child. He calls it “merely
a special sound associated with a special percept in
a quite casual and indefinite way.”</p>

<p>Froebel, too, is careful when he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A definite tone is to be connected with a
definite perception, and the tone when heard again
may recall the perception.”</p>

</div>

<p>Though Froebel has little to say about the separate
senses, and what little he has is worthless, yet on the
other hand he has a great deal to say, especially in
his later writings, about the child’s bodily activity,
and the experiences and perceptions (Erfahrung-Wahrnehmen)
he gains from it. Indeed he makes so
much of this, and it is so essentially a modern way of
thinking that it has been given a chapter to itself.</p>

<span class="smcap">How Consciousness is Differentiated.&mdash;The Place
of Action in the Development of Perception and of Feeling</span></h2>

<p>Once objects have begun to emerge, differentiated
out of the formless indistinctness, comes what
Froebel calls the “sucking-in stage,” where the child
“makes the external internal.”</p>

<p>Here, more than anywhere perhaps, Froebel shows
his genius, his originality as a student of child psychology,
in that he perceived that this mental sucking-in
is not merely a matter of sense organs, but that
it is also a muscular performance.</p>

<p>Who, before Froebel, understood the importance of
motor activity from the very earliest days, as a means
of gaining ideas, or realized as we now begin to do,
that this is the true explanation of the “endless
imitation which is the child’s vocation”?</p>

<p>In speaking of the “new-born child,” it is activity
or action which is again and again repeated and
emphasized as the outstanding characteristic, “an
activity and action devoted to working with and
prevailing over the outer.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As rest appears to be the earliest requirement
of the bodily life, so movement soon appears as
the demand of the soul life.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 63.</cite></p>

<p>The baby’s “feeble strength” is to be drawn into
the game, where possible, “particularly that he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
experience and perceive, directly through and in his
own activity” (durch und in Eigenthätigkeit unmittelbar
selbst erfahre und wahrnehme).&mdash;<cite>P., p. 78.</cite></p>

<p>It is “through spontaneous activity, as well as
through the mother’s instinctive knowledge of his
needs” that the child gains “the first impressions of
the soul, as it were, the first cognitions.”</p>

<p>Out of forty-nine Mother Songs, two only deal
specifically with the senses, though all deal with action,
and Froebel takes care to point out the close connection
of sense and movement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Limbs and senses seem to have very different
provinces of activity, and so they have; yet
so deep-seated is their linked interchange that
neither of them fails to react on the other. And
no Games for the limbs have presented themselves
to us, not even the ‘Kicking Song’ which
have not also made demands upon the sense of
sight.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 168.</cite></p>

<p>“The use of the body and of the limbs is
developed simultaneously and in the same proportion
as the use of the senses, the order being
determined by their own nature and the properties
of the material world. Outer objects are near, or
moving away, or fixed at a distance, and either
invite rest, seizure and holding fast, or invite him
who would bring them nearer to move towards
them.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 47.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel’s account of the significance of the ceaseless
activity of the young child anticipates to a certain
extent that of Mr. Irving King, who, in his most
interesting “Psychology of Child Development,” deals
expressly with “the functional relation of consciousness
to activity.” But the views of Professor Stout as
expressed in his “Analytic Psychology,” and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which Froebel’s writing has already been compared,
and those of Mr. Irving King do not appear to clash
in any way.</p>

<p>Mr. King begins by discussing the “sort of consciousness”
a young child must have, and concludes that it
must from the very first be a unified consciousness,
however vague, any discreteness being on the part of
the object. He also states that the consciousness of a
human being must differ from that of the animal
entering life with many “ready-made complexes of
adjustment,” because “Consciousness is related not to
activity, but to the growth of activity.” We have
just seen that Froebel too insists on a unified consciousness,
that he too says that “the external
world,” though composed always of the same variety
of objects, “comes to the child as ‘an undifferentiated
unity.’” Froebel is also quite sound as to the difference
between the mental possibilities of the animal
“whose instincts, as they are called, are at birth so
definite and strong,” and that of the child “born in
the extreme condition of helplessness,” by whom
“everything external is to be overcome.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Reflex and instinctive acts which the child brings
into the world with him, says Mr. King, are unconscious,
as are reflex and habitual activities to the adult, but
“the checking of a movement must make the child
more definitely conscious of it … it is no longer
mere movement, but movement-stopped-by-something.
As soon as movement stands out, as soon as the
consciousness of it is interwoven with something that
is not movement, we have the basis for indefinite
advance.”</p>

<p>Froebel says the same thing in the first of the
Mother Songs, where he takes as the point of departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for all future training this movement-stopped-by-something,
to which Mr. King refers as the earliest
beginning of consciousness. The mother is told that
when her baby “strikes out with his small arms, as he
kicks with his feet,” it is a challenge, to which she
instinctively responds by giving him her hand or her
chest, “against which he tramples with alternate feet
and so measures and increases his strength.” So, he
reaches “that first consciousness of self, which is
born of physical opposition to and connection with
the external world.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 171.</cite></p>

<p>Every one knows that Froebel laid much stress on
the necessity for what is usually called “expression,”
which he called <i lang="de">Darstellung</i>&mdash;often translated “representation.”
One of his reasons for this emphasis is, however,
by no means always understood, viz. that it “induces
clear perception.”</p>

<p>It is in discussing and criticizing Professor Baldwin’s
description of imitation as a circular process, that
Mr. Irving King brings out two points of view from
which we may regard imitation, that of the observer
and that of the so-called imitator. Imitation, he says,
is a term for the observer only, and not a term for
psychology at all. Baldwin says that “real or persistent
imitation is the reaction that will reproduce
the stimulating impression and so tend to perpetuate
itself.” But as Mr. King shows in the case of the
child who imitates his mother’s poking of the fire,
“the response of the child to the copy does not reinstate
the original stimulus.… What the child gets
is not a reproduced stimulus, but a new experience.”</p>

<p>In “The Education of Man,” written years before
his whole attention was given to the young child,
Froebel had emphasized the necessity for “representation”
which “induces and implies clear perception.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For what man tries to represent or do, that
he begins to understand.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 76.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As we have seen that Froebel sets before himself
the self-same task which Mr. King states as the
business of the genetic psychologist, so it should be
no surprise that he gives virtually the same answer to
the question: What do the imitative activities mean
to the child?</p>

<p>Mr. King’s answer is that the child’s emphasis is
not on the copying of a certain act, but on the attainment
of a certain experience that comes through the
copying or imitating. “The child,” he says, “is
seldom or never imitating from his own point of
view, but is always trying to sort out some of his
own ill-organized experiences.”</p>

<p>Froebel’s words are:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child, though unconsciously, strives to
make his inner life outwardly objective and thus
perceptible, and so to become conscious of it, to
see it mirrored in the outward phenomena. It
is for this reason that the child tries to do himself
whatever he sees done.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 240.</cite></p>

<p>“If your child is to understand any action, you
must let him carry it out himself, deeply rooted
in this fact is his prompt and delighted imitation
of whatever he finds around him.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 16.</cite></p>

<p>“Thought must form itself in action, and action
resolve and clear itself in thought.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 42.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Every stimulus, says Mr. King, is a suggestion to
activity, and it is interesting to notice how two minds
working on the same lines, though separated not only
by years but by difference of language, can fall into
almost the same phrases. Mr. King unconsciously uses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
almost Froebel’s very words when he writes: “<em>The
sight of the object tends to set the activity free</em>.”</p>

<p>Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the ball stirs, moves, goes, runs and rolls,
the child who is playing with it begins to feel the
desire to do likewise.… The smallest child moves
joyfully, springs gaily, hops up and down or beats
with his arms when he sees a moving object. This
is not merely delight in the movement of the object
before him, but it is the working of the inner
activity wakened in him by the sight of outer
activity. <em>Through such vision the inner life has
been freed.</em>”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 239.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>We have seen that according to Froebel the
earliest consciousness is a kind of self-consciousness.
Mr. Irving King says that the very beginning of
consciousness is “movement-stopped-by-something,”
and Froebel says that when the baby kicks out
or tramples with his feet and the mother responds
by giving him her hand or chest to push against,
the child reaches that “first consciousness of self
which is born of physical opposition to and connection
with the external world.” Here again we
come to a point in which Froebel’s insight shows
well in comparison with a typical modern genetic
psychologist. “Many writers,” says Mr. Irving King,
“have tried to select out certain kinds of activity as
peculiarly connected with the development of the
infant’s sense of self.” Preyer, for instance, connects
this development specially with painful sensations;
Baldwin, with experience associated with people, as
contrasted with experience of things. His own conclusion
is that “it seems more correct to say that
all the child’s activities are factors of very nearly
equal importance for developing the sense of self, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
distinct from things and other people,” and it is this
view that we find in Froebel’s writings. Even in
“The Education of Man” we find:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If man, in accordance with his destiny, is
truly and thoroughly to know each thing of the
surrounding world; if <em>with the aid of each thing
he is truly and thoroughly to know himself</em>.…”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 92.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And among his later writings, in connection with the
child’s play with bricks Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“True and early knowledge of Nature and of
the outer world and <em>especially clear self-knowledge</em>
come to the child by this early dismembering and
reconstruction and perception of real things, though
not as yet, by any means, through verbal designation
of the various productions of childish
activity.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 123.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>“Self-consciousness,” says Mr. King, “is essentially
a relative and variable term for all of us. It stands for
a process of definition, that, strictly speaking, proceeds
till maturity, or even later.” And Froebel, writing
about how, through the mother’s play with a ball,
a child may gain his earliest perceptions of object,
space and time, says that by the coming and going
of the ball, etc.,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“there goes forth to the child the object, recognized
as such by the mind and so held fast, the consciousness
of the object, and so consciousness itself
awakens in the child.”</p>

</div>

<p>And without a pause he goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Self-consciousness belongs to the nature of
man, and is one with it. To become conscious of
itself is the first task in the life of the child, as
it is the task of the whole life of man. That this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
task may be accomplished the child is, even from
his first appearance, surrounded by a definite
place and by objects: by the air blowing around
all living creatures, as well as by the arousing,
human, spiritual language of words.… Thus it
is with the attainment of man to consciousness
and the speech required and conditioned by that
attainment to consciousness.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 39.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is rather interesting to notice that in her translation
of this passage in which Froebel declares that
self-consciousness comes to a child as a result of all his
surroundings, Miss Jarvis omits the word “self.” She
begins her paragraph with “Bewusstsein,” instead of
“Selbstbewusstsein” as it stands in the original. To
quote Mr. King, “It is generally held that these are
two distinct attitudes, that consciousness may exist
without an accompanying consciousness of the self as
separate from the objects, activities and persons of the
rest of the world.” Probably this was Miss Jarvis’s
own view, and she left out the word “self” as having
no place or meaning in the context. It was, however,
not meaningless to Froebel himself.</p>

<p>Mr. King continues: “The really important point
is not to be able to put the finger down on some one
thing that proves a developed self-consciousness, but
to be able to show at every point that the process
of definition is a function of the growing complexity of
the child’s activities.” And, in “The First Action
of a Child” Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The nature of man as a being intended for
self-consciousness, shows itself in the quite distinctive
nature of the child’s activity, even at the
end of the so-called three months’ slumber, in the
totality of the first childish action. This cannot
be better comprehended than by the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
‘to busy himself’ (sich beschäftigen) in the impulse
of the child&mdash;an impulse awakening simultaneously
with his inner life&mdash;an impulse in close union with
feeling and perception, to be active for the increasing
development of his life: in this lies the nature
of man as a being intended to grow towards and
ultimately to become self-conscious.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 22.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Speaking of his second plaything, intended for a
child six months old, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And so his play, and through his play, his
surroundings&mdash;finally Nature and Universe&mdash;may
become a mirror of himself and of his life. But
this cannot be too early facilitated, that the child
at once, from the first beginning of his self-developing
feeling of life, may grow up in exchange
and comparison with Nature and life, and as he
impresses his life in form, and as form on things
outside, so he may again perceive his life therein.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 95.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel was bound to watch for early developments
of self-consciousness, because his whole philosophy and
pedagogy are based on his firm belief that while everything
in the universe is an expression of the Divine,
man alone is “destined” to express the God within
“with self-determination.” So, of the little child, he
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Because the child himself begins to represent
his inner being outwardly, he imputes the same
activity to all about him, to the pebble and chip
of wood, to the plant, the flower, and the animal.
And thus there is developed in the child at this
stage his own life, his life with parents and family,
and particularly his life in and with Nature, as if
this held life <em>like that which he feels within himself</em>.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 54.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>As the child grows older, the mother, Froebel
continues, tries to teach him to feel the complexity of
his own body, “Give me your arm,” “Where is your
hand?” she says, and she “playfully leads him to a
knowledge of the members which he cannot see,” and
the passage ends:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The aim of all this is to lead the child to self-consciousness,
to reflection about himself in the
approaching period of boyhood. Thus, a boy ten
years old, similarly guided by instinct, believing
himself unobserved, soliloquized: ‘I am not my
arm, nor my ear; all my limbs and organs I can
separate from myself, and I still remain myself;
I wonder what I am; who and what is this which
I call myself?’”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 56.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Nor does Froebel forget the idea of the self as the
boy grows older.</p>

<p>Once the activities of running, jumping, etc., are
familiar, the boy’s play takes on a new complexion.
His games are now “trials of strength,” or “displays
of strength.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The boy tries to see himself in his companions,
to feel himself in them, to weigh and measure
himself by them, to know and find himself by their
aid.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 114.</cite></p>

<p>“The life of the boy has, indeed, no other
purpose but that of the outer representation of
his self: his life is in truth but an external representation
of his inner being, of his power, particularly
through plastic material. In the forms he
fashions, he does not see outer forms which he
is to take in and understand; he sees in them
the expression of his spirit, of the activities of
his own mind.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 279.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely it is another touch of genius that makes
Froebel spring to the nascent idea of self as <em>the</em> reason
for the child’s craving for tales of all kinds.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Knowledge of a thing can never be attained
by comparing it with itself. Therefore the boy
cannot attain any knowledge of the nature and
meaning of his own life, by comparing it with
itself … everybody knows that comparisons with
somewhat remote objects are more effective than
those with very near objects. Only the study of
the life of others can furnish such points of comparison
with the life he has himself experienced.…
It is the innermost desire and need of a
vigorous boy to understand his own life.… This
is the chief reason why boys are so fond of stories,
legends and tales.… The story concerns other
men, other circumstances, other times and places,
yet the hearer seeks his own image, he beholds it,
and no one knows that he sees it.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 305.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As Froebel shows so much insight into the
paramount importance of action in the development of
self-consciousness, it is not surprising to find that he
recognizes also its special importance in the development
of feeling.</p>

<p>It is probably to the late Professor James and his
sparkling paradoxes that the educational world owes
its grasp of the importance of expression in connection
with feeling; we feel because we act, we are told, we do
not run away because we are afraid, but we are afraid
because we have run away. But all Froebelians had
already learnt the truth at the bottom of this from
Froebel’s Mother Songs.</p>

<p>When he wrote his earliest and greatest book, “The
Education of Man,” Froebel was already far enough
advanced to point out the necessity for at least verbal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
expression of feeling. He then advocated giving to
young boys simple prayers or words by which they
can express childish gratitude for care and protection,
so that these feelings may be retained and deepened.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is natural that religious feelings and
thoughts should spring up.… In the beginning
these sentiments and feelings will only manifest
themselves as an effect, a fullness without word
or form, without any adequate expression of what
they are, merely as something that uplifts our
being and fills the soul. At this juncture, it is
most beneficial, strengthening, and uplifting for
the boy to receive words&mdash;a language for these
sentiments and feelings&mdash;<em>so that they may not be
stifled in themselves, vanish for lack of expression</em>.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 246.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The same remark is made in connection with the
teaching of poems and songs. When feeling is aroused
by the contemplation of Nature, it must be expressed.
When Spring brings “gladness,” and Autumn “longing
and hope,” and when Winter awakens “courage and
vigour,” then:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Man, too, would express the thoughts and
feelings that are awakened in him and for which
he cannot find words, and these should be given
him.… the thoughtful teacher can easily interpret
the thoughts and feelings of the boys, as well
as the phases of Nature, in living fitting words.…
In general, all that was said concerning
the appropriation of religious expressions is true
here.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 267.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel had also noted even thus early how “the
natural mother” from the very beginning cultivates
feeling through expression, through gesture or action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mother love seeks to awaken and to interpret
the feeling of community between the child
and the father, brother and sister, when she says,
‘Dear Daddy!’ as she caressingly passes the
child’s hand over the father’s cheek. ‘Love
daddy, love little sister,’ etc.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 69.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In the Mother’s Songs, written much later and after
Froebel had made careful observation of young children,
he is more emphatic, and his ideas of expression are
both wider and more definite. In “The Education of
Man” he had said that literature exercises and tests
judgment and feelings, and he had added that this
should be followed up by some constructive action.
But now he knows that feeling when stirred ought to
express itself in actual service, just as James suggests
“speaking genially to one’s grandmother, or giving up
one’s seat in a horse car, if nothing more heroic offers.”</p>

<p>The mother is told that at first she should help
her little one to understand her care of him and his
dependence on her by “the looking-glass of outer life,”
by letting him, for instance, watch the hen caring for
her chickens, and the parent birds feeding and brooding
over their young in the nest. In the rhymed motto
of “The Nest” she is told:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Already the baby likes to see pictures showing
the loving care of a mother. Let him do so often,
that his life experience may become clear to him.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the longer explanation has an important
addition:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The way lies through our imaginative, tender
and emotional observation of Nature and of man’s
life, and through the child’s affectionately taking
their most intimate meaning into the life of his
own heart, <em>and expressing by representation what he
thus takes in</em>.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 149.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>So, as the child begins to realize what he owes,
comes the next little play, “The Flower Basket,” the
key-note of which is given in its motto:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Try to let the child give outward form to
what stirs his feelings, for the love even of a child
dies away if not carefully fostered.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 38.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And the baby makes of his tiny hands a basket for
flowers wherewith to celebrate the father’s birthday in
orthodox German fashion. In Froebel’s own phrase,
the “inner meaning” of the little finger play with its
picture, is “to cherish thoughtfully the bond, which is
invisible, yet which can be felt, whereby the life of
humanity is bound together, the first opportunity for
which is afforded by the life of the child and the family.”
What is important here is that Froebel has pointed
out the way in which this bond can be strengthened,
that is by expression, by giving “outward form to
what stirs feeling.”</p>

<p>This idea of service as expression of feeling comes
into Froebel’s description of the ideal child, “merry,
happy, strong and busy,” when the mother:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Kissed upon his brow her blessing,</div>
<div class="verse">Then, his love for her expressing,</div>
<div class="verse">Off he starts his mother serving</div>
<div class="verse">All he can do, she’s deserving.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 191.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, in connection with childish productions,
the little baskets, napkin rings, etc., that they have
made, Froebel wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The use made of these little productions is
very important to the civilizing and nourishing of
the child’s being and mind, for I consider the fact
that many children receive so much and can give
hardly anything to be one of the most essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
causes of the frequent retrogression of childish
love and sensibility.”</p>

</div>

<p>Froebel always emphasizes the essential importance
of family bonds in the development of feeling, and he
not only instructs the mother to see to it that the child
recognizes the family circle, but he tells her that he
will realize his “kinship” by service done for the
family.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Family, family, you are more than School
or Church … without you what are Altar and
Church.…”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 159.</cite></p>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“That many things are in a whole</div>
<div class="verse">Soon dawns upon a childish soul.</div>
<div class="verse">Then let the mother teach him carefully</div>
<div class="verse">To know the circle of the family.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 46.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Duties are not burdens, duty fulfilled leads to
light, this is why every healthy child likes and
enjoys doing duties, provided they speak to him
clearly and simply, above all inexorably.… See
how happy a child is feeling he has done his
small duties. He already feels his kinship with
you thereby. Cherish this feeling, and it will be
salvation and blessing to him.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 174.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As the feeling of the adult is called out by the
helplessness of a child, so, too:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“the child’s sympathy is roused by the young
creatures’ necessities more than by anything else,
and among these chiefly by their nakedness and
softness: ‘… Mother, the poor little birds are
so lonely, I am so sorry for the poor little things.’”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 150.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And in this connection too comes the warning that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
feeling must not be allowed to evaporate without
action:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If your child’s to love and cherish</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Life that needs him day by day,</div>
<div class="verse">Give him things to tend that perish</div>
<div class="verse indent1">If he ever stops away.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 84.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The child is “to feel within himself Nature’s close
interdependence”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whenever opportunity occurs, make this inner
dependence of life clear, visible, impressive, tangible
and perceptible to your child, even though it be in
only a few of the essential links of this great chain,
until you come to the last ring that holds all the
rest, God’s Father-love for all. The baker cannot
bake if the miller brings him no flour, the miller
can grind no flour if the farmer brings him no corn,
the field can yield no crop if Nature does not work
towards it in harmony, and Nature could not work
in harmony if God had not placed in her power and
material, and if His love did not guide everything
to its fulfilment.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 148.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And again, as always, follows the need for expression
of some kind. The children are not to be
disturbed while they “say grace” over their doll’s
feast.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is no drawing down of the sacred into outer
life; no, this is the germ which gives the outside
actions of life the inner meaning and higher consecration,
which life so much needs. For how is
your child to cultivate innocently in himself a
lively feeling for what is holy, if you will not grant
that it takes form for him even in his innocent
games.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 148.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be as well before leaving the subject to
notice here one or two other points in connection with
feeling that are touched upon by Froebel.</p>

<p>Though, as we have seen<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, the feeling side is always
kept in closest connection with those of knowledge and
action, yet the fundamental importance of the
emotional side is stated quite distinctly. The child is
“living, loving and perceiving,” or “creating, feeling
and thinking,” still:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The cultivation of boyhood rests wholly on
that of childhood; therefore activity and firmness
of the will rest upon activity and firmness of the
feelings and of the heart. Where the latter are
lacking, the former will scarcely be attainable.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 97.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This is put more strongly in connection with the
child’s imitation of the music of the bell note, the
“bim-baum” or “ding-dong” sung by the mother,
while she swings the ball to and fro, which according
to Froebel “serves the emotional side.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The children thus early and definitely point
out that the centre, the real foundation, the
starting-point of human development is the heart
and the emotions, but the training to action and
thought, the corporeal and mental, goes on constantly
and inseparably by the side of it; and
thought must form itself into action, and action
resolve and clear itself in thought; but both have
their roots in the emotional nature.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 42.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Another point Froebel makes in this connection,
is that feeling alone can awaken feeling, and that those
who complain of want of feeling in their children have
probably themselves to blame. Want of good feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and the prevalence among boys of egotism, unfriendliness,
etc., is explained as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“clearly due not merely to the failure of arousing
at an early period, and of subsequently cultivating
in the child a feeling of common sympathy, but
also to the early annihilation of this feeling between
parents and children.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 122.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The elders must show sympathy with the child’s
thoughts and feelings, they must not rest content with
caring for his bodily welfare. If the child fails to find
sympathy, for example in connection with his interest
in Nature, if he “fails to find the same feelings among
adults who suppress his germinating inner life” then,
says Froebel:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“a double effect follows, loss of respect for the
elder and a recoil of the original anticipation.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 164.</cite></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mothers and Fathers, is it not almost incredible
how early the child appears to distinguish
inner intellectual and loving gifts from outer bodily
ones, or, rather, to be conscious of the heart and
mind of the giver to feel the giving spirit? Who
does not see this in the effect of a friendly glance,
of a sympathizingly spoken word, of a tender care
which often affords little more than sympathy and
companionship?… It is a remarkable fact that
the mere love for the outward person, the mere
bodily care, does not satisfy him; indeed, the
nobler the child is in his nature the less does he
cling to the giving person. Through this consideration
we have found and recognized what we
sought, namely, that the respect and love&mdash;yea,
the reverence&mdash;of children and youth are gained
and secured to parents in proportion to what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
latter are doing for the education of the mental
life of the children.… If the lively appreciation
of what has been done to cultivate his inner world
fill the soul of a child, then will true love and
gratitude towards parents, respect and veneration
for age, germinate in the mind of a child.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 111.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>We have spoken in this chapter of what is popularly
called the instinct of imitation, and we have seen that
Froebel makes much of what he calls the instinct or
impulse of activity (Thätigkeitstrieb), or the instinct
for employment (Beschäftigungstrieb).</p>

<p>It may be well now to consider what, considering
the ideas of his day and generation, Froebel could find
to say on a subject so important as the instinctive
activities of human beings and of other animals, concerning
which so much has now been written and which,
according to Professor Dewey, Froebel regarded and
rightly regarded as the foundation-stones of educational
method.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smcap">Instinct and Instincts</span></h2>

<p>“The older writings on Instinct are ineffectual
wastes of words,” writes Professor James, “because
their authors never came down to this
simple and definite idea (that the nervous system is
to a great extent a pre-organized bundle of reactions),
but smothered everything in vague wonder
at the clairvoyant and prophetic power of animals&mdash;so
superior to anything in Man.”<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Froebel was certainly not in a position to know
much of the nervous system, but what he wrote about
instinct cannot be classed with these older writings.
For even without modern knowledge, he waxes indignant
over the opinions of those who created James’
“ineffectual wastes of words.” Far from allowing
that instinct in the lower animals is superior to anything
in man, Froebel maintains that the very weakness,
indefiniteness of man’s instincts or impulses
(Triebe) is a sign of his superiority.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Notwithstanding the early manifestation in
the human infant of the impulse to employment
(Beschäftigungstriebe), much has been said from
an entirely wrong point of view about man’s
helplessness at birth, and his slow development
to independence, which necessitates for so long a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
period the care and help of the mother. It has
even been said, that, in this respect, man’s position
is behind and below that of other animals.
But that very point, which has been cited as
evidence of man’s imperfection, is a proof of his
worth. For we recognize through this helplessness,
that man is called to ever higher self-consciousness.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 24.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>At the same time it should be pointed out that
Froebel does not make the opposite mistake of supposing
that man has no instincts. Since he approached
psychology from the biological side, so far
as it could be known to him, Froebel was bound to
have faith in instinct, in race-habit, in tendencies
which, because they have been of use to the race, are
bedded in the nature of each individual. It is to
Froebel’s later writings and especially to the little
paper, on “The First Action of a Child,” that we
must turn to see how wonderfully correct are his
views on the whole question of instinct.</p>

<p>It may be better to give first the position of
modern writers on the subject by quoting from the
last chapter of Professor Lloyd Morgan’s “Habit and
Instinct,” a clear and concise passage showing that
the contrary schools of thought represented on the one
hand by the Darwin and Romanes and on the other
by Professors James and Wundt, can after all be
resolved into a matter of definition.</p>

<p>“If, then, the question be asked, whether man
has a large or a small endowment of instinct, the
answer will depend upon the precise definition of
‘instinct.’ If we take congenital definiteness as
characteristic of instinct, we shall agree with Darwin,
that ‘the fewness and the comparative simplicity of
the instincts of the higher animals are remarkable as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
compared with those of lower animals;’ and with
Romanes that ‘instinct plays a larger part in the
psychology of many animals than it does in the psychology
of man.’ If, on the other hand, a broader
definition of instinct be accepted, so as to include
what is innate, in the sense before defined, we shall
agree with Professor Wundt that human life is ‘permeated
through and through with instinctive action,
determined in part, however, by intelligence and
volition;’ and shall not profoundly disagree with
Professor Wm. James, who says that man possesses
all the impulses that they (the lower animals) have
and a great many more besides.”</p>

<p>In Mr. McDougall’s important contribution to the
discussion of human instinct, he says that the view
which is rapidly gaining ground is that the gradual
evolution of intelligence “did not supplant and lead
to the atrophy of the instincts, but controlled and
modified their operation.” As Mr. McDougall goes on
to state his belief “that the recognition of the full
scope and function of the human instincts will appear
to those that come after us as the most important
advance made by psychology in our time,” it is important
to the purpose of this book, to make clear to
what extent Froebel’s views on the subject approach
those of modern writers.</p>

<p>Mr. McDougall makes a very clear distinction
between specific tendencies to which he limits the
word instinct, and non-specific or general tendencies.
Naturally Froebel did not reach this standpoint, but
he does seem to have thought out his terminology.
He felt strongly as to the use of words of foreign
origin, and generally uses “<i lang="de">Trieb</i>,” “<i lang="de">Lebenstrieb</i>,”
“<i lang="de">Drang</i>” or “<i lang="de">Lebensdrang</i>,” where we might use
instinct. But he does occasionally use “instinct,”
notably in a passage quoted below “whose impulses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
powers and abilities, whose instincts as they are
called” (dessen Lebenstriebe Kräfte und Anlagen,
dessen Instincte wie man es nennt), where he seems
to be feeling about for the right expression. Other
words in constant use are “<i lang="de">Neigung</i>,” “<i lang="de">Streben</i>” and
“<i lang="de">Richtung</i>,” probably best translated by “tendency.”
It can be argued, however, that to the word Trieb
Froebel does seem to have attached a more definite
meaning, and his use of this word is certainly limited.</p>

<p>Professor James’ account of instinct begins with
the statement that “Every instinct is an impulse,” a
driving to action, but the use of the words “<i lang="de">Trieb</i>”
and “<i lang="de">Drang</i>” makes such a pronouncement unnecessary
to a German writer, and if this root idea is
not implied by the noun, it generally, in Froebel’s
writings, makes its appearance in the verb. Thus we
frequently read of “a longing which drives the child
to,” etc. (die Sehnsucht die das Kind treibt).</p>

<p>The merest glance through Froebel’s writings is
enough to show his belief in the existence of instinct
in the human being. His references to it are constant.
It is an impulse (Trieb) “which the child did not give
himself, which came without his will, in later life even
against his will,” but which “urges to action” (drängt
ihn dazu). It is a force so strong, that it “holds
captive mind and body.” The child is described as
“driven by impulse” (des von Lebensdrang getriebenen
Kindes). The boy again is “held captive by
harmless, even praiseworthy, impulses” (sogar lobenswerten
Triebe), or “gives himself up entirely to the
impulses of his inner life” (dem Treibenden innern
Leben).</p>

<p>In his earlier work, “The Education of Man,”
Froebel is first concerned with urging that the young
human being, “a product of Nature,” has instincts
quite as trustworthy as those of any other young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
animal, and the following eloquent passage is very
well known:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The undisturbed working of the Divine
Unity is necessarily good, and this implies that
the young human being, still as it were in the
process of creation, would seek as a product of
Nature, though still unconsciously, yet decidedly
and surely that which is in itself best: and, moreover,
in a form wholly adapted to his condition,
disposition, powers and means. Thus the duckling
hastens to the pond, while the young
chicken scratches the ground, and the young
swallow catches his food upon the wing and
scarcely ever touches the ground. We grant
space and time to young plants and animals
because we know that in accordance with the
laws that live in them they will develop properly
and grow well. Arbitrary interference with their
growth is avoided because it is known that this
would disturb their development; but the young
human being is looked upon as a piece of wax,
a lump of clay, which man can mould into what
he pleases.… Thus, O parents, could your
children, on whom you force in tender years
forms and aims against their nature, thus could
your children too unfold in beauty and develop
in harmony.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 7.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is true that to Froebel evolution is “the working
of Divine Unity.” But there seems to be no
special reason why this should invalidate what Froebel
has to say, any more than Sir Oliver Lodge should be
disqualified as a scientist, because he has produced a
book in which he writes: “Development means unfolding
latent possibilities … growth and development
are in accordance with the law of the universe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
… the law of the universe and the will of God are
here regarded as in some sort synonymous terms.”</p>

<p>This is exactly Froebel’s position; he writes that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nature and man have their origin in one
and the same eternal Being, and their development
takes place in accordance with the same
laws, only at different stages.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 161.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>That Froebel not only recognized the presence of
instinct in human beings, but that he also saw, as
Professor Wundt puts it, that this is “determined in
parts by intelligence and volition,” he states very
plainly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Natural instinct and good example will do
much, but here, as in all human concerns, one
must proceed by extension of knowledge, and by
careful scrutiny, or both the one and the other
may mislead or be misdirected. Experience
cries aloud to us, to warn us of this danger.
<em>Assuredly man ought not to neglect his natural
instincts, still less abandon them, but he must ennoble
them through his intelligence, purify them through his
reason.</em>”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 222.</cite></p>

<p>“In the progress of development three stages
differentiate themselves and fall apart; and these
stages are seen both in individual men, and in the
race as a whole. They are:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Unconsciousness, the merely instinctive stage</em>;</p>

<p>(2) <em>Vague Feeling, the tendency upwards towards
consciousness</em>; and</p>

<p>(3) <em>Relatively clear Conscious Intelligence</em>.</p>

<p>Everything that is acquired by a great unity,
say by a family, a community, a nation, must in
its beginnings be acquired by the single members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of that unity; and further it will take them in
one of the three grades of development, either that
of mere unconsciousness, or of vague feeling, or in
the third and highest grade, that of conscious
intelligence, so far as it has been maintained by
mankind up to the present time.”&mdash;(Letter to
Madame D. Lutkens, dated March, 1851.)</p>

</div>

<p>It is in “The First Action of a Child” that we
find Froebel contrasting the instincts of the lower
animals with those of man. Here curiously enough,
Froebel, according to Professor Stout, is almost more
correct than Professor Lloyd Morgan himself, whose
statement “that animals do not perceive relations”
Professor Stout regards as misleading. His correction
is, “unless an artificial restriction is put on the meaning
of the term <em>relation</em>, this statement would imply
that animals cannot perceive the position of objects
in space or their motion.… Hence we should say,
not that the perception of relation is deficient in
animals, but only that definite perception of relations
is deficient which depends on comparison.”</p>

<p>Now it is this very point of comparison which
Froebel takes as the essential intellectual difference
between the animal independent from birth thanks to
fully developed instinct, and the child helpless and
apparently inferior at first, yet destined for progress
“self-active and free.” He writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The animal whose life impulses, powers and
abilities, whose instincts as they are called (dessen
Lebenstriebe, Kräfte und Anlagen, dessen Instincte
wie man es nennt) are at once so definite
and strong, that in natural conditions it never
fails, indeed cannot fail to overcome every hindrance
within its life’s reach, the animal just on
this account can never arrive at a knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
its powers, its qualities, its nature … <em>for it
lacks all points of comparison. It lacks all points
of comparison, which, in the case of man proceed
from the fact that the weakest output of strength
meets with obstacles</em> which increase as the strength
increases, and which will only with difficulty be
conquered or overcome and annihilated.</p>

<p>“It is quite different in the life of man, in the
beginning of which practically nothing can be
accomplished without help from without.
Nothing especially can be accomplished through
a preponderance of inner power such, for example,
as the newly hatched duckling shows on the
water. Thus everything external must, by Man,
with his preponderance of helplessness, be overcome
as an obstacle solely through inner advancing,
and outer strengthening and increasing of
power through free activity of the will.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 25.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>With this passage from “The First Action of a
Child” we can compare the following from Stout’s
“Analytic Psychology”:</p>

<p>“The peculiar feature in the life of animals which
prevents progressive development is the existence of
instincts which do for them what the human being
must do for himself. Their inherited organization is
such, that they perform the movements adapted to
supply their needs on the mere occurrence of an appropriate
external stimulus.… In man, a blind craving
has to grope its way from darkness into light in order
to become effective; in the animal the means of satisfaction
are provided ready made by Nature at the
outset.”</p>

<p>After having stated that “Every instinct is an
impulse,” Professor James goes on to say that instinct
depends upon the biological fact that the nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
system is “a pre-organized bundle of re-actions,” and
that when impulses block one another, an animal
with many impulses, and whose mind is elevated
enough to discriminate, “loses the instinctive demeanour
and appears to live a life of hesitation
and choice, an intellectual life.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the very obvious fact that Froebel
could know but little of the nervous system and its
re-actions, it is still quite evident that his observation
had led him to a clear recognition of the earlier stage,
when “hesitation and choice” are impossible. The
child, he says, “acts in obedience to an instinct which
holds captive mind and body,” he is “incredibly
short-sighted in his obedience to instinct.” That he
also recognized the beginning of hesitation and choice
is shown in his defence of the child who “in spite of
abandonment to momentary impulse,” may have
“an intense inner desire for goodness,” which, “if it
could be appreciated in time,” would make of him a
good man (<cite>E., p. 125</cite>); and also in his plea for the
early awakening and training “of judgment and of
that reflection which avoids so many blunders and
which, <em>in a natural way</em> (i.e. without training), does
not come to man sufficiently early.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 79.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Another source of boyish faults is in the
precipitation, want of caution, indiscretion, in a
word the thoughtlessness, the acting according to
an impulse quite blameless, even praiseworthy,
which holds captive all activity of mind and body,
but whose consequences have not as yet entered
into his experience, indeed it has not yet entered
into his mind to define the consequences.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 122.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel gives from real life a few well-chosen
examples of what the boy so “incredibly short-sighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in his obedience to impulse” may do; telling how
one deliberately aims a stone at a window “with
earnest effort to hit it, yet without even saying to
himself that if it does so, the window must be broken,”
and how he “stands rooted to the spot” when this
happens. Another, a “very good-hearted boy, who
dearly loved and took care of pigeons, aimed at his
neighbour’s pigeon on the roof, without considering
that if the bullet hit it the dove must fall.” No
wonder that he urges the early awakening of that
reflection (Nachdenken) which would avoid so much,
and in this connection it must be remembered too that
Froebel emphasized the indefiniteness of human instinct
which makes comparison possible. It is also
worth remarking that Froebel knew that it is only
by noting consequences of actual deeds that reflection
comes, and this he shows in one of his quaint parallels
between “the history of creation and the development
of all things.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Similarly in each child there is repeated the
deed which marks the beginning of moral and
human emancipation, of the dawn of reason&mdash;essentially
the same deed that marked the dawn
of reason in the race as a whole.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 41.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It must have been a somewhat unorthodox view
in 1826, but some pages further on Froebel speaks
even more boldly of “the fall or&mdash;since the result is
the same&mdash;the ascent of the mind of man from simple
emotional development into the development of
externally analytic and critical reason.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 193.</cite></p>

<p>Professor James goes on to state two other principles
which make for non-uniformity of instinct.
The first of these is that instincts are inhibited by
habits, and the second that instincts are transitory.</p>

<p>The physiological fact of “plasticity” in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
these principles are grounded, was of course quite out
of Froebel’s ken. Nevertheless, the principles themselves
do not escape his shrewd observation. Mr.
McDougall points out that even acquired habits of
thought and action, so important as springs of action
in the developed human mind, are in a sense derived
from and secondary to instincts. He goes on to say
that “in the absence of instincts no habits could be
formed,” so it is interesting to find Froebel arguing
that the phenomena of habit is a proof of the existence
of what in the infant he calls the impulse to activity
or to self-employment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The helplessness of the new-born human
being in regard to all outer things is the opposite
of his future ability&mdash;since life is a whole&mdash;to help
himself through the enhancing of his will-power.…
Helplessness and personal will, therefore,
become the two points between which the child’s
life turns, and the fulcrum is free activity. Herein
lies for the educator a key to phenomena of
child-life which seem to contradict each other.
For out of the impulse to activity (Thätigkeitstriebe)
and to free self-employment, or rather out
of the united three&mdash;helplessness, personal will,
and self-employment&mdash;soon proceed custom and
habit, often indolence and too facile yielding.</p>

<p>“Consideration of custom, and of the spontaneous
acquiring of habit in the child, especially
in regard to what causes it, and to its effect upon
the child, is just as important for the educator,
as is the consideration and guidance of his instinct
of activity. This very phenomenon that the child
so early accustoms and inures himself to something,
this early phenomenon of child life, the
growing together and becoming one, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with his surroundings, is a proof of the existence
and inner working, even thus early, of the impulse
for activity or employment, even where the child
appears outwardly inactive and passive: in that
the child accommodates himself to outer surroundings,
relations and requirements in order to
provide more scope for his inner activity.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 27.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This proof may not be quite so clear to others as
it was to Froebel, but at least the passage shows the
close connection in his mind between instinct&mdash;the
impulse towards activity and employment&mdash;and habit,
and that he had noted the interaction between the two.</p>

<p>There are many references to the transitory nature
of at least childish impulses.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What delight a child takes in noticing what
is smooth, woolly, hairy, sparkling, round, etc.…
But if you do not cherish this and do not
set it going in the right way, it becomes a lost
thing; it grows rusty, and loses its power as a
magnet loses its power when it is not sufficiently
used. Power that is not at once used, effort that
does not at once meet the right object&mdash;perishes.”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 181.</cite></p>

<p>“Now, at last, we would fain give another
direction to the energies, desires and instincts
(Kräfte, Neigungen und Triebe) of the child
growing into boyhood; but it is too late. For
the deep meaning of child-life passing into boyhood
we not only failed to appreciate, but we
misjudged it; we not only failed to nurse it, but
we misdirected and crushed it.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 75.</cite></p>

<p>“See parents, the first impulse to activity, the
first constructive impulse (Bildungstrieb) comes
from man according to the nature of the working of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his mind, unconsciously, unrecognized, without
his will, as man can indeed perceive in himself in
later life. If, however, this inner summons to
activity (diese innere Aufforderung zur Thätigkeit)
meets with outer hindrance, especially such
a one as the will of the parents, which cannot be
set aside, the power is at once weakened in itself,
and with many repetitions of this weakening,
falls into inaction.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 100.</cite></p>

<p>“The neglect of inner power causes the inner
power itself to vanish.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 133.</cite></p>

<p>“It is true there are few such children; but
there would be more, were we not ignorantly
blunting so many tendencies in our children, or
starving them into inanition.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 220.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Writing of the origin of boyish faults Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When we look for the sources of these shortcomings
… we find a double reason, first, complete
neglect of the development of certain sides
of human life, secondly early misdirection, early
unnatural stages in development, and distortion,
through arbitrary interference with human powers,
qualities and tendencies good in their source.…
Therefore at the bottom of every shortcoming in
man, lies a crushed, frustrated quality or tendency,
suppressed, misunderstood or misguided.”&mdash;<cite>E., pp. 119-121.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>When we come to the enumeration of the various
human instincts we find that Froebel can hardly be
said to have omitted any that are important from an
educational point of view, except perhaps the instinct
of fear, and to this he would be loth to appeal.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Moreover, it can be shown that his explanation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
certain tendencies suggests a better basis of classification
than is supplied by certain recent writers, who
might be expected to surpass him with ease.</p>

<p>Before the publication of Mr. McDougall’s “Social
Psychology,” there were but few attempts at any classification
of instincts within at least the reach of
English readers. In July, 1900, there appeared an
article in “The Pedagogical Seminary” in which Mr. Eby
proposed to reconstruct the Kindergarten on the basis
of natural instinct. The writer had apparently no
dawning idea that this was the original basis<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of the
institution he proposes to reform, but Froebel’s account
of Instinct shows in certain ways a clearer understanding
of the subject than does his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Eby’s tabulation was:</p>

<p>Another classification, well known at least to
teachers, is that given by Mr. Kirkpatrick in his
“Fundamentals of Child Study.”<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>His list comprises:</p>

    <td class="indented">(Including such tendencies as those of collecting and constructing, and the
    tendency to adornment, with the æsthetic pleasure of contemplating beautiful objects.)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Interesting, helpful and suggestive as these lists
are, they both serve as examples of the difficulty, if
not impossibility, of any hard-and-fast lines of classification.
For example, regulative instincts, which Mr.
Kirkpatrick divides into moral and religious, must be
derived from social instincts; gregarious instincts
cannot be satisfactorily separated from instincts of
self-preservation, and surely all instincts must be
adaptive.</p>

<p>Froebel’s account of the instincts of a child in some
ways resembles that of Mr. McDougall, and it is
certainly in some points more enlightening than either
of the others.</p>

<p>Under the heading of Investigation, Froebel brings
both the Number Instinct, and the Interest in Stories,
to which Mr. Eby gives a position as fundamental as
that of the Social Instinct. The constructive instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which Mr. Kirkpatrick brings under “Resultant and
Miscellaneous,” has a very special place in Froebel’s
account, as being one way of imitating, that is another
mode of investigating the surroundings, and also what
is equally important, a way by which the child gains
a knowledge of his own power, reaches Self-Consciousness.</p>

<p>It is because of the emphasis Froebel continually
lays upon the developing self-consciousness that his
views somewhat tend to resemble those of Mr.
McDougall, though it would be absurd to attempt to
draw any parallel. For Froebel, though he in no way
minimizes the importance of Imitation, and although
it is as the apostle of Play that he is most widely
known, yet, like Mr. McDougall, he never speaks either
of an Instinct of Play nor of Imitation, that is, he
never uses for these his special word Trieb; nor has
he any Instinct for Religion. Curiously enough, too,
Froebel, with his constant insistence on the threefold
aspect of mind, partly forestalls Mr. McDougall’s view
that “instinctive action is the outcome of a distinctly
mental process, one which is incapable of being described
in purely mechanical terms, … and one which, like
every other mental process, has and can only be fully
described in terms of the three aspects of all mental
process, the cognitive, the affective, and the conative
aspects.”</p>

<p>It is in connection with the very earliest activity
that Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first phenomenon of awakening child-life
is activity. It is an inner activity, showing itself
by consideration of and working with what is
outer, by overcoming hindrances and subduing the
outer. The nature of man as growing towards,
and destined to reach self-consciousness, is shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in the quite peculiar character of childish activity
even as early as when the infant awakes from its
so-called three months’ slumber. It is shown in
the child’s impulse to busy himself (in dem Triebe
sich zu beschäftigen) in the instinct, <em>one with
feeling and perception</em>, to be active for the progressive
development of his own life.</p>

<p>“We are repeatedly impressed with the conviction
that everything that is to be done for the
specifically human development of the child must
be connected with the fostering of this instinct to
employ himself. For <em>this instinct corresponds to
man’s triune activity of doing, feeling and thinking.
It corresponds to the essential nature of humanity,
which is to have power and understanding, to become
ever more and more self-conscious and self-determining.</em>”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 24.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In the last sentence of this passage, which refers
to the merest infant, and which immediately precedes
Froebel’s comparison of human instincts with those of
the lower animals, are indicated the lines on which we
may say Froebel classified though he never did so
formally. He deals only with the “purely” or “specifically”
human, as he never tires of reiterating, so
that fundamental animal instincts, self-preserving and
race-preserving, such as feeding and the sexual impulse,
are little noticed, and only in connection with the
necessity for self-control.</p>

<p>But, as with Mr. McDougall much is made to
depend on self-feeling, so with Froebel still more does
everything centre round that self-consciousness which
to him is of the very nature of man, and which is
made possible by the undefined or undeveloped
character of human instinct.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>The instincts and impulses noted by Froebel, all,
be it clearly understood, in the service of the growing
self-consciousness, and self-determination are: the
instinct to independent activity (der Trieb zur Frei-
und Selbst-thätigkeit), the instinct to investigation
(Forschungstrieb), with which Froebel deals very
thoroughly and by which he explains a great deal, the
impulse of acquisition, the instinct of construction or
formation (Bildungstrieb Gestaltungstrieb), the social
instinct and the maternal instinct.</p>

<p>Froebel himself never tabulates, yet his apparently
careful use of the word Trieb, taken along with his
convincing explanations of various tendencies (Richtungen,
Neigungen, Streben) seems to show that in
relation to instinct there were in his mind two pairs
of ideas, so closely related as to be inseparable, viz.:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Investigation and Control of Surroundings, and
(<i>b</i>) Consciousness of Self and Self-Determination.</p>

<p>It is impossible to become conscious of one’s self
except by becoming conscious of a world of objects.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
It is equally impossible to become self-determining
without gaining control over these objects, over the
surroundings. In order to control the surroundings,
one must first investigate them, and this investigation
brings with it self-consciousness, knowledge of one’s
own powers and consequent self-determination. All
this seems fully in accordance with what has been
already stated as to the close connection between
volitional and intellectual development.</p>

<p>The two main lines on which instinctive action
must run, if it is to be, as it must be, adaptive, are
given in Froebel’s words, “to have power and understanding.”
To adapt ourselves to our surroundings
we must first know them, and secondly, have power
over them. Even this separation into firstly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
secondly is more a matter of words than of reality.
No one knew more clearly or emphasized more strongly
than Froebel that action, by which alone we gain
power, is also the child’s royal road to knowledge.
This he states very plainly in the “Plan” which he
drew up for the school at Helba, which unfortunately
never came into existence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The institution will be fundamental inasmuch
as in training and instruction it will rest on the
foundation from which proceed all genuine knowledge
and all genuine practical attainments; it
will rest on life itself and on creative effort, on the
union and interdependence of doing and thinking,
representation and knowledge, art and science.
The institution will base its work on the pupil’s
personal efforts in work and expression, making
these, again, the foundation of all genuine knowledge
and culture. Joined with thoughtfulness
these efforts become a direct medium of culture;
joined with reasoning, they become a direct means
of instruction and thus make of work a true
subject of instruction.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 38.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Knowledge of his surroundings is however not the
only knowledge that the child gains through action;
this is his only way of gaining knowledge of himself,
of his power and of his weakness. It is through outward
activity that, as Froebel says, he “comes to
self-consciousness and learns to order, determine and
master himself,” and it is in connection with the earliest
Impulse to Activity that Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The present effort of mankind is an effort
after freer self-development, freer self-formation,
freer determining of one’s own destiny.…
Therefore the more or less clear aim of the
individual is Consciousness, the attaining of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
clearness about himself and about life in its
unity as well as in its thousand ramifications,
to attain to <em>comprehension and right use</em> of life.…
That this highest aim may be accomplished,
the present time lays upon the educator the
indispensable obligation&mdash;to understand the earliest
activity, the first action of the child, the
impulse (Trieb) to spontaneous activity, which
appears so early; to foster the impulse (Trieb) for
self-culture and self-instruction, through independent
doing, observing and experimenting.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 15.</cite></p>

<p>“The first spontaneous employments of the
child are noticing his environment, and play, that
is, independent outward action, living outside
himself.… The deepest foundation of all the
phenomena, of the earliest activity of the child
is this; that he must exercise the dim anticipation
of conscious life, and consequently must
exercise power, test and thus compare power,
exercise independence, test and thus compare the
degree of independence.”&mdash;<cite>P., pp. 29-31.</cite></p>

<p>“All outer activity of the child has its distinctive
and ultimate ground in his inmost nature and
life. The deepest craving of this inner life, this
inner activity, is to behold itself mirrored in some
external object. In and through such reflection
the child learns to know his own activity, its
essence, direction and aim, and learns also to
order and determine his activity in correspondence
with the outer phenomena. Such mirroring of
the inner life, such making of the inner life objective
is essential, for through it the child comes to
self-consciousness, and learns to order, determine
and master himself. The child must perceive and
grasp his own life in an objective manifestation
before he can perceive and grasp it in himself.”&mdash;<cite>P.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
p. 238.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It may seem very presumptuous to venture to
discuss here the classification of instincts adopted by
Mr. McDougall, yet there are in it a few points which
would not have appealed to Froebel, and it is conceivable
that Mr. McDougall might make alterations
in a future edition and attach even more importance
to positive self-feeling as Froebel would undoubtedly
have done. It is impossible to imagine Froebel having
any dealings with an Instinct of Self-Abasement,
though the Instinct of Self-Assertion is in full accordance
with his ideas. And while it is hard to see the
biological utility of an Instinct of Self-Abasement, it
does seem as if the frustration of the Instinct of Self-Assertion
might be made to cover all that is brought
under its opposite.</p>

<p>It is difficult, too, to imagine Froebel allowing an
Instinct of Pugnacity, and Mr. McDougall allows that
this presupposes the other instincts, and that it cannot
strictly be brought under his own definition of
instinct. He allows, too, that this instinct is “lacking
in the constitution of the females of some species,”
and it seems impossible not to notice the difference
between little boys and girls in this respect. Surely
it puts too much to the credit of mere pugnacity to
say: “A man devoid of the pugnacious instinct would
not only be incapable of anger, but would lack this
great source of reserve energy, which is called into
play in most of us by any difficulty in our path.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The Instinct of Self-Assertion, if it is worth anything,
ought to be sufficient not only to produce anger,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
but also to call up reserve energy to deal with difficulties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Certainly Froebel would have said so. No
doubt it is because of her weaker physique that the
woman has not the pugnacity of the man, but Froebel
too wrote mainly of the boy, and he puts boyish
tussling and fighting down to the instinctive desire to
measure and to increase power and this can easily be
matched on the female side, though the power
measured may not be that of muscle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At this age the healthy boy brought up
simply and naturally never evades an obstacle,
a difficulty; nay he seeks it and overcomes it.
‘Let it lie,’ the vigorous youngster exclaims to
his father, who is about to roll a piece of wood
out of the boy’s way&mdash;‘let it lie, I can get over it.’
With difficulty, indeed, the boy gets over it the
first time; but he has accomplished the feat by
his own strength. Strength and courage have
grown in him. He returns, gets over the obstacle
a second time, and soon he learns to clear it easily.…
The most difficult thing seems easy, the most
daring thing seems without danger to him, for
his prompting comes from the innermost, from his
heart and will.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 102.</cite></p>

<p>“Many of the plays and occupations of boys
at this age are predominantly mere practice and
trials of strength, and many aim simply at display
of strength.… <em>The boy tries to see himself in his
companions, to feel himself in them, to weigh and
measure himself by them, to know and find himself
with their help.</em>”&mdash;<cite>E., pp. 112-114.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In passing, it may be suggested that it hardly seems
worth while to postulate an Instinct of Repulsion with
the impulses or actions of rejecting evil-tasting substances
from the mouth and of shrinking from objects
which are slimy or slippery. Surely the rejection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
unsuitable food might be a compound reflex action
tending to the preservation of health; while shrinking
from slimy objects, and even from the touch of fur,
might have had their uses in the case of children left
in caves, and might be drawn under the instinct of
fear.</p>

<p>There does not seem to be anything to which Mr.
McDougall would take exception in what Froebel has
to say about Play or about Imitation.</p>

<p>As to play, Froebel must be regarded as a pioneer
in the attempt to explain a subject all important to
educators, and by his explanation certain kinds, and
notably imitative play find an appropriate place under
his instinct of investigation (Forschungstrieb).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The means of shadowing forth to the child
his own nature and that of the cosmos are his play
and playthings.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 201.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As the word Investigation certainly implies
activity, it may be permissible to wonder why Mr.
McDougall has not made use of the terms “The Instinct
of Investigation and the Emotion of Curiosity,”
the more so that he himself has clearly a strong inclination
to use the word curiosity to express emotion.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Imitation, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> is, according to
Froebel, action which renders a child conscious of
what is around him, conscious of his inner life of perceptions,
ideas and feelings, conscious of his own
power. Froebel also points out that imitation, as well
as habit, is the outcome of a more fundamental
impulse to activity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is just as important to notice the habits
of a child, especially with regard to cause and
effect, as it is to notice and to foster its impulse
to activity.… As now habit springs from free
and spontaneous activity, so too does imitation,
and it is no less important for the fostering of
child-life to keep in view this origin of imitation,
than it is to keep in view the phenomena of habit,
custom and independent activity. For we see the
whole inner life of the child manifest itself as a
tri-unity in the threefold phenomenon of spontaneous
activity, habit and imitation. These
three phenomena are closely united in early
childhood, and give us most important discoveries
concerning child-life, as to foundation and result
and surest guides for the early correct treatment
of the child.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 27.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. McDougall notes “at least three distinct
classes” of imitative actions. The first class consists
of expressive actions, secondary to the sympathetic
induction of the emotions they express, as when a
child responds to a smile with a smile, and here we
remember how Froebel notes the child’s first smile to
his mother as the earliest sign of what he calls “the
feeling of community.” The third class is the deliberate
and voluntary imitation of an admired person,
which does not concern us here. The second class
are “simple ideo-motor actions evoked by the visual
presentation of a movement,” and as a parallel to this
we have Froebel’s “working of the inner activity
wakened by the sight of outer activity.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The smallest child moves joyfully, springs
gaily, hops up and down, or beats with his arms
when he sees a moving object. This is certainly
not merely delight in the movement of the object
before him, but <em>it is the working of inner activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wakened in him by the sight of outer activity</em>.
Through such vision the inner life has been freed.…”&mdash;<cite>P.,
pp. 239-40.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>A point to which exception may well be taken is
that in the infant Froebel notes what he seems to
regard as a fundamental tendency, the impulse or
instinct of activity, or as he frequently puts it, the
impulse to busy oneself, which, however, soon differentiates
into two more specific tendencies, viz. the
impulse to investigate and the constructive impulse.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What formerly the child did only for the
sake of activity, the boy now does for the sake of
the result or product of his activity. The child’s
impulse to activity (Thätigkeitstrieb) has in the
boy become a constructive, a formative impulse
(Bildungs-Gestaltungstriebe), in which the whole
outer life of the boy finds at this stage its outlet.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 99.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It may be worth mentioning that Groos would like
to assume a “universal impulse to activity,” and
though he “can only hold fast to the primal need for
activity,” yet according to him Ribot approaches this
assumption.&mdash;(“The Play of Man,” <cite>p. 3</cite>).</p>

<p>Even in the infant, however, this instinct or impulse
to activity is devoted to “penetrating what is
outer,” and the Kindergarten, meant for children from
three to six, is intended to foster the three instincts,
activity, investigation and construction, as well as to
cultivate the social instinct by placing a little child
among his equals. Froebel describes it in his plan
as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An Institution
for fostering of family life and for shaping the
life of the nation and human life generally, through
cultivating the human instincts of activity, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
investigation (Forschungstrieb), and of construction
in the child, as a member of the family, of the
nation, and of humanity.…”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 6.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As regards the child, the word Trieb, which is
exactly equal to impulse, seems to be applied only in
one other direction, to what we would call the social
instinct, and here again Froebel shows his recognition
of the vagueness and indefiniteness of early consciousness.
As he attributes to the infant the one impulse
to activity which differentiates later into Investigation
and Construction, so in the infant he recognizes a
“feeling of community” (Gesammtgefühl), but says
that it differentiates later into something more definite.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The development of man constitutes an
unbroken whole, steadily and continuously progressing,
gradually ascending. The feeling of
community (Gemeingefühl) awakened in the infant,
develops in the child into impulse, inclination
(entwickelt sich in dem Kinde der Trieb, die
Neigung).”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 95.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Under the important Instinct of Investigation, or
the Instinct for Self-Instruction, Froebel includes a
great deal. Many different activities until recently
somewhat carelessly talked of collectively as “play,”
Froebel has separated and explained as the child’s
way of investigating his surroundings. Even “the
earliest activity and first action of the child,” Froebel
says, shows “the instinct to self-teaching and self-instruction.”</p>

<p>Imitative action or imitative play is always
referred to as action which helps towards understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the surroundings. In the “Mother Songs”
we read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your child will certainly understand all the
better if you make him take a part&mdash;though it
be only by imitation&mdash;in what grown-up people
are doing in their anxiety to maintain life.…”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 141.</cite></p>

<p>“I have already said that this little game
arose because people felt that a child’s love of
activity, and his striving to get the use of his
limbs, ought to be carried on in such a way as to
lift him at once into the complexity of the life
which surrounds him.… Pray do not disturb
them in their ingenious charming play (saying
grace over the dolls’ feast), but rather avoid
noticing it if you cannot identify yourself with
its charm.… For how is your child to cultivate
in himself the feeling of what is holy, if you will
not grant that it takes form for him in all its purity
in his innocent games.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 148.</cite></p>

<p>“What man tries to represent he begins to
understand.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 76.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Representation, however, may be carried out in
many ways, by the use of material, as well as by
bodily action so that the constructive instinct also
subserves that of investigation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To grasp a thing through life and action is
much more developing, cultivating and strengthening
than merely to receive it through the
verbal communication of ideas. Similarly, representation
of a thing by material means, in life and
action, united with thought and speech, is more
developing than merely verbal representation of
ideas.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 279.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child must perceive and grasp his own
life in an objective manifestation before he can
perceive and grasp it in himself. This law of
development, prescribed by Nature and by the
essential character of the child, must always be
respected and obeyed by the true educator. Its
recognition is the aim of my gifts and games
apprehended relatively to the educator.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 38.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Here Froebel has plainly stated the main object of
his specially selected play-material. The ordinary
parent not being “the man advanced in insight,” who
“makes clear to himself the purpose of playthings,”
Froebel often saw children supplied with expensive
but unsuitable toys, toys which would not bring the
child any nearer his destination, “to have power
and understanding, to become ever more and more
self-conscious and self-determining.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here, then, we meet as a great imperfection
in ordinary playthings, a disturbing element
which slumbers like a viper under roses, viz. that
it is too complex, too much finished. The child
can begin no new thing with it, cannot produce
enough variety by it; his power of creative
imagination, his power of giving outward form to
his own idea is thus actually deadened. When
we provide children with too finished playthings,
we deprive them of the incentive to perceive the
particular in the general (<cite>P., p. 122</cite>).… What
presents are most prized by the child? Those
which afford him a means of unfolding his inner
life most freely and of shaping it in various directions.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 142.</cite></p>

<p>“The man, advanced in insight, should be as
clear as possible in his own mind about all this
before he introduces his child into the outer world.
Even when he gives the child a plaything, he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
make clear to himself its purpose, and the purpose
of playthings and occupation material in general.
This purpose is, to aid the child freely to express
what is in him and to bring the phenomena of the
outer world nearer to him.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 171.</cite></p>

<p>“To realize his aims, man, and more particularly
the child, requires material, if it be only
a bit of wood or a pebble with which he makes
something or which he makes into something.
In order to lead the child to the handling of
material, we gave him the soft ball, the wooden
sphere and cube, etc., discussed in the chapters
on the Kindergarten Gifts. Each of these gifts
incites the child to free spontaneous activity, to
independent movement.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;<cite>P., p. 237.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As the child grows older his constructions advance,
but still they connect themselves with investigating:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here he makes a little garden under the
hedge; there he represents the course of the river
in his furrow and in his ditch; there he studies
the effects of the fall or pressure of water upon
his little water-wheel.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 105.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Investigating naturally leads to exploring, “external
objects invite him who would bring them nearer
to move toward them,” and so the child once he is
able to stand begins to travel:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the child makes his first attempts at
walking he frequently tries to go to some particular
object. This effort may have its source
in the child’s desire to hold himself firm and
upright by it, but we also observe that it gives
him pleasure to be near the object, to touch it,
to feel it, and perhaps also&mdash;a new phase of
activity&mdash;to be able to move it. Hence we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the child hops up and down before it and beats
on it with his little hands, in order to assure
himself of the reality of the object, and to notice
its qualities.… Each new phenomenon is a
discovery in the child’s small and yet rich world&mdash;e.g.
one can go round the chair, one can stand
before, behind, beside it, but one cannot go
behind the bench or the wall. He likes to change
his relationship to different objects, and through
these changes he seeks self-recognition and self-comprehension,
as well as recognition of the
different objects which surround him, and recognition
of his environment as a whole. Each
little walk is a tour of discovery; each object
is an America&mdash;a new world, which he either
goes around to see if it be an island, or whose
coast he follows to discover if it be a continent.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 243.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The boy has lost none of this tendency to explore,
but he goes further afield, and it is worth noting that
because the boy has a distinct purpose in view his
exploring is distinctly called work.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If activity brought joy to the child, work
now gives delight to the boy. Hence the daring
and venturesome feats of boyhood; the explorations
of caves and ravines; the climbing of trees
and mountains; the searching of heights and
depths; the roaming through fields and forests.…
To climb a new tree means to the boy the
discovery of a new world.… Not less significant
of development is the boy’s inclination
(Neigung) to descend into caves and ravines, to
ramble in the shady grove and dark forest.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
pp. 102-5.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<p>Even the baby shows trace of the collecting or
acquiring instinct, but to Froebel this still falls under
the head of investigation. The child who has just
learned to walk is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“attracted by the bright round smooth pebble,
by the quaint brilliant leaf, by the smooth piece
of wood, and he tries to get hold of these with
the help of the newly acquired use of his limbs.
Look at the child that can scarcely keep himself
erect and that can walk only with the greatest
care&mdash;he sees a twig, a bit of straw; painfully he
secures it.… See the child laboriously stooping
and slowly going forward under the eaves. The
force of the rain has washed out of the sand
small, smooth, bright pebbles, and the ever-observing
child gathers them.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 72.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The boy, still only from six to eight years old,
keeps up the collecting habit with more method and
with a wider range, and he demands assistance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not less full of significance, nor less developing,
is the boy’s inclination to descend into caves
and ravines, to ramble in the shady grove and in
the dark forest. It is <em>the effort</em> (<i lang="de">Streben</i>) to seek
and find the new, to see and discover the hidden,
the desire to bring to light and <em>to appropriate</em>
that which lies concealed in darkness and shadow.</p>

<p>“From these rambles the boy returns with
rich treasures of unknown stones and plants, of
animals&mdash;worms, beetles, spiders and lizards, that
dwell in darkness and concealment. ‘What is
this? What is its name?’ etc., are the questions
to be answered; and every new word enriches
his world and throws light upon his surroundings.
Beware of greeting him with the exclamation,
‘Fie, throw that down, that is horrid!’ or ‘Drop
that, it will bite you!’ If the child obeys, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
drops and throws away a considerable portion of
his power.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 104.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This quotation brings us to another mode of investigation,
that of asking questions, which Froebel was
not likely to miss.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child, your child, ye fathers, follows you
wherever you go. Do not harshly repel him.
Show no impatience about his ever-recurring
questions. Every harshly repelling word crushes
a bud of his tree of life.… Question upon question
comes from the lips of the boy thirsting for
knowledge&mdash;How? Why? When? What for?
and every satisfactory answer opens to him a new
world.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 86.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Professor O’Shea has an interesting section on
what he calls “The Sense of Location,” which he says
is “at the bottom of one of the most interesting and
important phenomena of adjustment&mdash;the questioning
activity.” So it may be worth while to notice that
Froebel, whom the Professor has dismissed with one
slighting reference, has been beforehand with him here,
and has dealt with this same early beginning in one
of his earliest Mother Songs, viz. “It’s all Gone,”
where he says to the mother:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How can the child understand that anything
is “all gone,” yet he must see sense in it or he
will not be satisfied. What he saw just now is
there no longer, what was above is below, what
was there has vanished.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 18.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Questioning implies language, but Froebel has no
language instinct. He does, however, call speech
immediate (unmittelbar), usually translated “innate,”
and he does say that because others talk to him, the
child’s capacity for speech will develop of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and will break forth spontaneously.</p>

<p>It is in connection with the child’s earliest investigations
that Froebel brings in the learning to speak.
In “The Education of Man,” he notes how the young
child brings all his discoveries, “his treasures,” to the
mother’s lap, and she is warned to give the right kind
of help and at the right time.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the longing for interpretation that urges
the child to appeal to us, it is the intense desire
for this that urges him to bring his treasures to
us and to lay them in our laps. The child loves
all things that enter his small horizon and extend
his little world. To him the least thing is a new
discovery; but it must not come dead into the
little world, nor lie dead therein lest it obscure
the small horizon and crush the little world.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 73.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>All the help the mother need give at first is to
supply names, since as Froebel says, “the name, as it
were, creates the thing for the child.” Later she must
help him to compare and classify.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How little is needed from those around the
child to aid him in this tendency (to seek for
knowledge). It is only necessary to name, to put
into words what the child does, sees and finds.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 75.</cite></p>

<p>“It is as well while the child is making these
first experiments (at walking about the room) to
name the objects&mdash;e.g. There is the chair, the
table, etc.… The object of giving these names
is not primarily the development of the child’s
power of speech, but to assist his comprehension
of the object, its parts and its properties by
defining his sense-impressions. By a rich store
of such experiences the capacity for speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
develops of necessity, and speech breaks forth of
itself, as it were, through heightened mental self-activity
in accordance with the nature of mind.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 242.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Expression, of course, of which speech is but one
form, is to Froebel all-important. “Speech,” he says,
is “required and conditioned by the attainment to
consciousness,” and as self-consciousness is the characteristic
of humanity, so speech is “the first manifestation
of mankind.” In his “Autobiography” Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mankind as a whole, as one great unity, had
now become my quickening thought. I kept this
conception continually before my mind. I sought
after proofs of it in my little world within and in
the great world without me; I desired by many
a struggle to win it, and then to set it worthily
forth. And thus I was led back to the first appearance
of man upon our earth, and to the first
manifestation of mankind, his speech.”&mdash;<cite>A., p. 84.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In talking of the mother’s play with an infant he
says that she accompanies every action with words,
“even if obliged to confess that there can be no understanding
of the spoken word,” as “the general sense
of hearing is not yet developed, still less the special
sense of hearing words.” Froebel says she is right:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“for that which will one day develop and which
must originate, begins and must begin when there
is as yet only the conditions, the possibility
thereof. Thus it is with the attainment of the
human being to consciousness, and the speech
required and conditioned by consciousness.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 40.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>Words, says Froebel, first separate the child from
the world outside him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Up to this stage (the beginning of speech),
the inner being of man is still an unmembered,
undifferentiated unity. With language, the expression
and representation of the internal begin;
with language, organization, or a differentiation
with reference to ends and means sets in.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 50.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Both in the earlier “Education of Man,” and in
his later writings Froebel uses the strong expression
that “the word creates the thing” for the child, and
in one passage he adds that by language the idea is
defined and retained.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This period is pre-eminently the period of
the development of speech. Therefore in all the
child did, it was indispensable that what he did
should be clearly designated by words. Every
object, every thing became such, as it were, only
through the word; before it had been named
although the child might have seemed to see it
with the outer eyes, it had no existence for the
child. The name, as it were, created the thing
for the child; hence the name and the thing
seemed to be one.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 90.</cite></p>

<p>“Through her little rhymes the mother will
make clear to the little one what he has done, and
so his accidental productions will become a point
of departure for his self-development. Word and
form are opposite and yet related. Hence the
word should accompany the form as its shadow.
In a certain sense, giving a form a name really
creates the form itself. Through the name, moreover,
the form is retained in memory and defined
in thought.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 192.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>Of very early speech Froebel says that it shows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“the peculiarity and requirement of the human
mind to render itself intelligible to clarify itself
by communication with others.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 56.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Having investigated his surroundings, near or far,
and collected what seems to him attractive, the child,
whether older or younger, arranges his treasures in
some way, and this arrangement implies some comparison.
“Like things must be ranged together and
things unlike must be separated,” says Froebel of the
child “scarce able to walk,” who has collected “the
small, smooth, pebbles washed out of the sand by the
rain.” This “arranging objects of each kind singly
in a row” is at first no doubt only a recognition of the
like and unlike, but Froebel notes that it is also one
way in which the child may arrive at “the capacity
for counting” by which his sphere of knowledge is
again extended.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The knowledge of the relations of quantity
adds much to a child’s life.… At first he places
together similar objects.… Who has not had
frequent opportunity to observe how the child
arranges the objects of each kind singly in a row.
Let the mother supply the quickening word,
saying Apple, apple, apple, etc. All apples.
Pear, pear, pear, etc. All pears.… One pear,
another apple, another apple.… Instead of the
indefinite word “another” the mother subsequently
uses the numerals, counting together with
the child, thus: One apple, two apples, three
apples, etc.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 80.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To many children, however, counting may come
through efforts to draw. I have seen a child of four-and-a-half,
in drawing a man, make a line for the arm,
then lay down her pencil to count her own fingers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
then draw five lines for the man’s hand. Froebel
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The representation of objects by drawing,
and the exact perception conditioned and required
by the representation, soon leads the child
quickly to recognize the constantly repeated
association of certain numbers of different objects&mdash;e.g.
two eyes and two arms, five fingers, etc.
Thus the drawing of the object leads to the discovery
of number.… By the development of
the capacity for counting, the child’s sphere of
knowledge, his world, is again extended.…
He was unable to determine relative quantities,
but now he knows that he has two large and three
small pebbles, four white and five yellow flowers,”
etc.&mdash;<cite>E., p. 80.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Yet another mode of Investigation is that of
Experimenting; every normal child is what Froebel
calls “a self-teaching scientist.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The material must be known not only by its
name, but by its qualities and uses.… For this
reason the child examines the object on all sides;
for this reason he tears and breaks it; for this reason
he puts it in his mouth and bites it. We reprove
the child for his naughtiness and foolishness; and
yet he is wiser than we who reprove him. An
instinct which the child did not give himself, the
instinct which rightly understood and rightly
guided would lead him to know God in his works,
drives him to this.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 73.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It may well be through his ceaseless experimenting
that the little child begins to draw, gains what the late
Mr. Ebenezer Cooke called “a language of line,” or
as Froebel puts it, notices “linear phenomena, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
direct his attention to the linear properties of surrounding
objects.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A child has found a pebble, a fragment of
lime or chalk. In order to determine by experiment
its properties, he has rubbed it on a board
near by, and has discovered its property of imparting
colour. See how he delights in the newly
discovered property, how busily he makes use of
it! … but soon he begins to find pleasure in the
winding, straight, curved, and other forms that
appear. These linear phenomena direct his attention
to the linear properties of surrounding
objects. Now the head becomes a circle, and now
the circular line represents the head, the elliptical
curve connected with it represents the body;
arms and legs appear as straight or broken lines,
and these again represent arms and legs; the
fingers he sees as straight lines meeting in a
common point, and lines so connected are, for the
busy child, again hands and fingers; the eyes
he sees as dots, and these again represent eyes;
and thus a new world opens within and without.
For what man tries to represent, that he begins
to understand.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 75.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>I have watched a child go through the process
of discovering “linear phenomena,” just as Froebel
describes it, no doubt from his own observation. A
boy of three, having folded a piece of paper for the
roof of a house, was colouring it, by rubbing on red
chalk, when he called out, “Oh! I’m making lines.”
The other children went on rubbing, but Phil made
“lines” till the roof was finished.</p>

<p>But Froebel does not leave unnoticed the fact that
the very earliest “drawing” is an outgrowth of the
muscular action to which his instinct of activity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
urged by the stimulus of contact.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Would you know how to lead the child in
this matter? Watch him, he will teach you what
to do. See! he is tracing the table by passing
his fingers along its edges and outlines as far as
he can reach, he is sketching the object on itself.
This is the first and the safest step by which he
becomes aware of the outlines and forms of
objects. In this way he sketches and so studies
the chair, the bench, the window. But soon he
advances. He draws lines across the four-cornered
bit of board, across the leaf of the table,
or the seat of the chair, in the dim anticipation
that so he can retain the forms and relations of
the surfaces. Now, already he draws the form
diminished.</p>

<p>“See! there the child has drawn table, chair
and bench on a leaf of the table. Do you not
see how he spontaneously trained himself for
this? Objects which he could move, which were
in sight, he laid on the board, and drew their form
on the plane surface, following the boundaries of
the objects with his hands. Soon scissors and
boxes, and later leaves and twigs, even his own
hand and the shadows of objects will thus be
copied.</p>

<p>“Much is developed in the child by this action,
more than it is possible to express&mdash;a clear comprehension
of form, the possibility of representing
the form separate from the object, the possibility
of retaining the form as such, and the strengthening
and fitting of hand and arm for the free representation
of form.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 77.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Here, perhaps, is the right place to introduce what
Froebel had to say about the artistic tendencies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
children, since Art, to him, is always expression.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Absolutely nothing can appear, nothing visible
and sensible can come forth, that does not
hold within itself the living spirit; that does not
bear upon its surface the imprint of the living
spirit of the being by whom it has been produced,
and to whom it owes its existence. And this is
true of the work of every human being&mdash;from
the highest artist to the meanest labourer&mdash;as
well as of the works of God, which are Nature,
the creation, and all created things.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 153.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>So, when Froebel comes to speak of art as a subject
of the school curriculum he says: “Here, art will be
considered only as the pure representation of the inner
… differentiated according to the material it uses,
whether motion, as such, audible in sound, or visible
in lines, surfaces and colours, or massive”; and he
adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We noticed that even at an earlier stage
children have the desire to draw, but the desire
also to express ideas by modelling and colouring
is frequently found at this earlier stage of childhood,
certainly at the very beginning of the stage
of boyhood (from six years old). <em>This proves
that art and appreciation of art constitute a general
capacity or talent of man</em>, and should be cared for
early, at latest in boyhood.</p>

<p>“This does not imply that the boy is to devote
himself chiefly to art, and is to become an artist;
but that he should be enabled to understand and
appreciate true works of art. At the same
time, a true education will guard him from the
error of claiming to be an artist unless there is
in him the true artistic calling.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 227.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>In connection with the mother’s instinctive rhythmic
crooning and dandling of the infant, Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus the genuine natural mother cautiously
follows in all directions the slowly developing all-sided
life of the child. Others suppose him to be
empty.… Thus those means of cultivation that
lead so simply and naturally to the development
of rhythm are lost.… Nevertheless an early
development of rhythmic movement would prove
most wholesome.… Even very small children,
in moments of quiet, and particularly when going
to sleep, will hum little strains of songs they have
heard; and this should be heeded and developed
as the first germ of future growth in melody and
song. Undoubtedly this would soon lead in children
to a spontaneity such as is shown by children
in the use of speech.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 71.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In the “Mother Songs,” too, Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hence it is so very important to rouse at
least the germs of all this (the perceiving of harmony
in sound and form and colour) early in a
human being. If they do not develop and take
shape as independent formations in life, they at
least teach how to understand and recognize
those of other people. This is life-gain enough.
It makes a person’s life richer&mdash;richer by the
lives of others. And how could our earthly life
be long enough to form our being with equal
perfection on all sides. We can only do it by
knowing and respectfully recognizing in the
mirror of the lives of others what we should like
to carry out ourselves. And this is as it should
be, for it is by means of knowledge, regard for
and respectful recognition of others, that the
whole of humanity ought to represent the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of a God-like harmonious human being.”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 162.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In what he says of the Interest in Stories, Froebel
again seems to show deeper insight than either Mr.
Eby or Professor Kirkpatrick. Mr. McDougall does
not touch upon the subject. It is still the outcome
of the child’s instinctive desire to understand himself
and his surroundings. Froebel says very truly that
he can only understand others in proportion as he
understands himself, and can only learn to understand
himself, his own life, by comparing it with that
of others. The desire for stories is “a striving, a
longing, a demand of the mind” (ein Streben, eine
Sehnsucht, eine Forderung des Gemüthes). For the
little one, the simplest story of the mother bird feeding
her young ones is a help to the understanding of his
own life, makes his own life objective; the mother’s
“effective story will hold up a looking-glass to the
child, especially if it be told at the right time.” For
the boy the story does the same and also answers to
his instinctive demand not only to understand the
present, but the past:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the innermost desire and need of a
vigorous, genuine boy to understand his own life,
to get a knowledge of its nature, its origin and
outcome. Only the study of the life of others
can furnish such points of comparison with the
life he himself has experienced. In these the
boy, endowed with an active life of his own, can
view the latter as in a mirror and learn to appreciate
its value. This is the chief reason why boys
are so fond of stories, legends and tales; the more
so when these are told as having actually occurred
at some time, or as lying within the reach of
probability, for which, however, there are scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
any limits for a boy.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 305.</cite></p>

<p>“The existence of the present teaches him the
existence of the past. That, which was before he
was, he would know; he would know the reason,
the past cause of what now is. Who fails to
remember the keen desire that filled his heart
when he beheld old walls, and towers, ruins,
monuments and columns on hill and the roadside&mdash;to
hear others give accounts of these things,
their times and causes … thus is developed the
desire and craving for tales, legends, for all kinds
of stories, and later for historical accounts.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 115.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Even the fairy story seems to have found its
legitimate place under the same heading, the instinct
for investigation. Froebel sees that it covers for the
little child the ground occupied by myth in the primitive
consciousness. It explains the otherwise inexplicable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Even the present in which the boy lives still
contains much that at this period of development
he cannot interpret, and yet would like to interpret;
much that seems to him dumb, and which
he would fain have speak; … and thus there is
developed in him the intense desire for fables and
fairy tales which impart language and reason to
speechless things&mdash;the one within, the other
beyond the limits of human relations. Surely all
must have noticed this if they have given more
than superficial attention to the life of boys at
this age. Similarly, they must have noticed that
if the boy’s desire is not gratified by those around
him, he will spontaneously hit upon the invention
and presentation of fairy tales, and either work
them out in his own mind or entertain his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with them. These fairy tales and stories
will then very clearly reveal to the observer what
is going on in the innermost mind of the boy,
though doubtless the latter may not himself be
conscious of it.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 116.</cite></p>

<p>“The child, like the man, would like to learn
the significance of what happens around him.
This is the foundation of the Greek choruses,
especially in tragedy. This, too, is the foundation
of very many productions in the realms of legends
and fairy tales, and is indeed the cause of many
phenomena in actual history. This is the result
of the deeply-rooted consciousness, the deeply
slumbering premonition of being surrounded by
that which is higher and more conscious than
ourselves.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 146.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The outcome of the instinct of construction, which
is also so closely connected with the instinct of investigation,
is that “sense of power” which <em>is</em> self-consciousness.
Without this there can be no self-determination,
but, says Froebel, “the sense of power
must precede its cultivation.” With this growing
personality, too, Froebel connects what is called the
instinct of Acquisition, which begins when the little
child “painfully secures his bit of straw,” and the boy
of six to eight shows “the tendency to appropriate
what he finds in the darkness of cave and forest.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The same tendency that urges the boy to
seek knowledge on the mountain and in the
valley, attracts and holds him to the plain. Here
he makes a garden, there he represents the course
of the river, and studies the effect of the presence
of water … here he has dammed up the water
to form a pool.… He is particularly fond of
busying himself with clear running water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
with plastic materials. In these the boy who
seeks self-knowledge beholds his soul as in a
mirror. These employments are to him an
element of his life, for now, because of a previously
acquired sense of power he seeks to
control and master new material. Everything
must submit to his constructive instinct; there
in that heap of earth he digs a cellar and on it
he places a garden and a bench. Boards,
branches and poles must be made into a hut,
the deep, fresh snow must be rolled up to form
the walls and ramparts of a fort, and the rough
stones on the hill are heaped together to form a
castle.… And thus each one soon forms for
himself his own world; for the feeling of his own
power requires and conditions also the possession
of his own space and his own material belonging
exclusively to him. Whether his kingdom, his
province, his estate, as it were, be a corner of
the yard, or of the house, or whether it be the
space of a box, the human being must have at
this stage an external point to which he refers
all his activities, and this is best chosen and
provided by himself.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 106.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And here, just when he is emphasizing the fast
developing consciousness of self, with its demand for
its own space and its own material, Froebel brings out
the strength of the social instinct in boyhood. It is
here that he points out that this effort to construct
has a uniting, not a separating, tendency. Continuous
with the last quotation comes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“When the space to be filled is extensive,
when the province to be ruled is large, when the
whole to be represented is composed of many
parts, then brotherly union of those who are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
one mind is displayed. And when those who are
of one mind meet and put their hearts into the
same effort, then either the work already begun
is extended or begun again as a joint production.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 107.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel describes such joint work first in the
Keilhau schoolroom&mdash;his own phrase is “education
room”&mdash;where the younger boys are using building
blocks, sand, sawdust, and moss, which they have
brought in from the forest around and then among
the older boys.</p>

<p>“Down yonder by the brook, how busy are
the older boys with their work! They have made
canals with locks, bridges and seaports, dams
and mills, each undisturbed by the others. But
now the water is to be used to carry ships from
one level to another, and now, at every stage,
each boy asserts his own rights while recognizing
the rights of others. How can they settle their
difficulties? Only by making agreements, and
so, like States, they bind themselves by strict
treaties.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 111.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Of games of physical movement, running, wrestling,
etc., Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the sense of power, the sense of its
increase, both as an individual and as a member
of a group, that fills the boy with joy, in these
games.… The boy tries to see himself in his
companions, to weigh and measure himself by
them, to find and know himself by their help.
Thus the games directly influence and educate the
boy for life, they awake and cultivate many civic
and moral virtues. Every town should have its
common playground for the boys. Glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
would be the results from this for the entire community.
For at this stage of development games
whenever possible are held in common, thus
developing the sense of community and the laws
and requirements of a community.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 113.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel had studied boys to some purpose, and he
tells us not, however, to expect too much in the way
of social virtues. Justice, self-control, honesty,
courage and “severe criticism of pleasant indolence”
may be expected, but mutual forbearance and consideration
for those who are weaker or less familiar
with the game, though not entirely lacking, are referred
to as “the more delicate blossoms” of the playground.
It is here that he says with wise moderation, “The
feeling of power must precede its cultivation.”</p>

<p>The social instinct does not suddenly spring into
existence in boyhood. It has its roots in what Froebel
calls the Feeling of Community which unites the child
first with the mother, then with father, brothers and
sisters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We cannot deny that there is at present among
children and boys little gentleness, mutual forbearance
… indeed, there is much egotism, unfriendliness
and roughness. This is clearly due not only
to the absence of early cultivation of the feeling
of community, but this sympathy between parents
and children is too often disturbed, yes even
annihilated.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 119.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The sympathy of the little child ought to be
trained and is trained by the wise mother always
through action.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mother love seeks to awaken and to
interpret the feeling of community, which is so
important, between the child and the father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
brother and sister, saying while she draws the
child’s little hand caressingly across the face of
the father or of the little sister, ‘Love the dear
father&mdash;the little sister.’”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 69.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In the Finger Play called “The Nest,” Froebel
tells the mother:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The way lies through our imaginative, tender
and emotional observation of Nature and of man’s
life, through the child’s taking their meaning into
his own heart and expressing by representation
what he thus takes in.… The child’s sympathy
is roused by the young creatures’ necessities
more than by anything, and chiefly by their
nakedness and softness.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 149.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And the action which fosters the growth of sympathy
is not to be merely representative; The Garden
Song has this motto:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If your child’s to love and cherish
Life that needs him day-by-day,
Give him things to tend that perish
If he ever stays away.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 84.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is because “the desire for unity is the basis of
all true human development” that the child is to be
encouraged to help in the work he sees going on around
him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Family, family&mdash;let us say it openly and
plainly&mdash;you are more than School and Church,
and therefore more than all else that necessity
may have called into being for the protection of
right and property … without you, what are
Altar and Church?… Therefore, Mother, in the
little finger game, teach your child some notion
of the nature of a whole, especially of a family-whole.”&mdash;<cite>M.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
p. 159.</cite></p>

<p>“We have not yet touched nor even considered
an important side of child-life, the side of association
with father and mother in their domestic
duties, in the duties of their calling.… (<cite>E.,
p. 84</cite>). Do not let the urgency of your business
tempt you to say, ‘Go away, you only hinder
me.’ … After a third rebuff of this kind
scarcely any child will again propose to help and
share the work.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 99.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is an essential part of the Kindergarten to consider
the child as a member of the human family. It
is described in one place as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An establishment for training quite young
children, in their first stage of intellectual development,
where their training and instruction shall
be based upon their own free action or spontaneity,
acting under proper rules … such rules
as are in fact discovered by the actual observation
of children when associated in companies.
(<cite>L., p. 251</cite>).… Practice in combined games
for many children, which will train the child, by
his very nature eager for companionship, in the
habit of association with comrades, that is, in
good fellowship and all that this implies.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 252.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Among his Group Instincts Mr. Kirkpatrick mentions
the Love of Approbation, and this receives
special attention from Froebel at a surprisingly early
stage. It is in the “Mother Songs,” in connection
with his adaptation of an old German nursery rhyme
about knights who come to visit “a good child,” that
Froebel tells the mother that:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A new life stage has begun, and you, dear
Mother, must use your best and most watchful
care, when first the child listens to a stranger.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the same connection he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child must be roused to good by inclination,
love and respect, <em>through the opinion of
others around him</em>, and all this must be strengthened
and developed.… When, therefore,
Mother, observation as to the judgment of others
awakes in your child&mdash;when, separating himself
and on the watch <em>he brings himself before the
judgment of others</em>, then you really have a double
task to perform.…”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 190.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The Love of Approbation cannot be separated from
what Mr. Kirkpatrick calls the Regulative, i.e. the
Moral and Religious Instincts, for it is both social
and regulative, and in the social instincts Froebel
sees the foundation of the religious instincts or tendencies,
to which we shall come presently. But he
also notes a “sense of order,” as Mr. Sully does in his
delightful “Studies of Childhood,” and this he traces
back to very early beginnings, connecting it with the
tendency towards rhythm.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That disorder and rough wilfulness may
never enter the games, it is a good plan wherever
it is possible to accompany each change in the
play by rhyme and song; so that the latent sense
of rhythm and song, <em>and above all the sense of
order in the human being and child</em>, may be aroused
and strengthened to an impulse for social cooperation.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 267.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>One of the earliest Mother Plays, “Tic-tac,” deals
with rhythmic movement, and in “The Education of
Man” Froebel takes the beginning of “conscious
control” still further back. His ideal mother fosters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
“all-sided life,” that is, she fosters the cognitive,
emotional and conative, the first by calling the child’s
attention to his own body and his immediate surroundings,
and the second by “seeking to awaken and
to interpret the feeling of community between the
child and the father, brother and sister,” and Froebel
goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In addition to the sense of community as
such, the germ of so much glorious development,
the mother’s love seeks also through movements
to lead the child to feel his own inner life. By
regular rhythmic movements&mdash;and this is of
special importance&mdash;she brings this life within the
child’s conscious control when she dandles him
up and down on her hand or arm in rhythmic
movements and to rhythmic sounds. Thus the
genuine natural mother cautiously follows in all
directions the slowly developing all-sided life in
the child, strengthening and arousing to ever
greater activity, and developing the all-sided life
within. Others suppose the child to be empty
and wish to inoculate him with life, and thus
make him as empty as they think him to be.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 69.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is surprising to find that Froebel,
writing so early, has nothing at all resembling any
special “moral faculty.” His references to “Conscience”
are decidedly interesting, though given in
quaint connection with games and rhymes for mere
babes. He asks why the “Where’s Baby?” game
gives such delight, and shows his psychological insight
in the answer he finds, viz. that it is the feeling or
recognition of self, of personality, which gives such
joy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Why, now, is my child so happy over the
hiding game? It is the feeling of Personality
which already so delights the child, it is the feeling
of recognition of his own self.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The game which follows this repeats the hiding
experience, but this time with the cry of “cuckoo,”
from some one unseen, and this is likened to the conscience
call, which is described as “consciousness of
union in separation and of separateness, that is personality,
in union.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 98.</cite></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In ‘Where’s Baby Been?’ parting and union
seem more separate, as though in order that each
may become more and more clearly conscious of
itself; in ‘Cuckoo,’ parting and union are, as it
were, joined. It is parting in union and union in
parting that makes ‘Cuckoo’ such a peculiar
game and so delightful to a child. But consciousness
of union in separation, and of separateness&mdash;that
is personality&mdash;in union, is also the
essence, the deep foundation of conscience.”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 197.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Kirkpatrick’s second Regulative instinct or
tendency is that of Religion, but Froebel again, like
Mr. McDougall, finds that Religion has its roots in
an instinct “not specifically religious,”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> viz. in the
Social Instinct. He says this in “The Education of
Man” in the plainest of terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This feeling of Community first uniting the
child with father, mother, brothers and sisters,
and resting on a higher spiritual unity, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
later on is added the discovery that father, mother,
brothers and sisters, human beings in general,
feel and know themselves to be in community and
unity with a higher principle&mdash;with humanity,
with God&mdash;this is the very first germ, the very first
beginning of all true religious spirit, of all genuine
yearning for unhindered unification with the
Eternal, with God.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 25.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It seems quite in accordance with this that Froebel
should write that he likes better the German word
<i lang="de">Gott-einigkeit</i>&mdash;union with God&mdash;than the foreign word
religion; and also that he should speak of “developing
the sense of kinship with man in every child, and the
sense of kinship with God in every man.” So, in his
“Mother Songs,” he tells the mother to give her child
duties to perform, that so he may “feel his kinship”
with her:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every age, even the age of childhood, has
something to cherish that is plain, and from
doing so no exemption can be procured; it has
therefore its duties. Happy is it for a child if
he be led to deal with them adequately, and
for the present unconsciously. Duties are not
burdens.… Fulfilment of duty strengthens body
and mind, and the consciousness of duty done
gives independence; even a child feels this.
See, Mother, how happy your child is in feeling
he has done his small duties. He already feels his
kinship with you thereby.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 174.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>There is never a separation between Morality and
Religion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Religion without industry, without work, is
liable to be lost in empty dreams, worthless
visions, idle fancies. Similarly, work or industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
without religion degrades man into a beast of
burden, a machine. Work and religion must be
simultaneous; for God, the Eternal has been
creating from all eternity.… Where religion,
industry and self-control, the truly undivided
trinity rule, there indeed is heaven upon earth.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 35.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>There is only one other instinct mentioned by
Froebel, and that is the parental, or, rather, the
maternal instinct. He is eager that this should be
recognized as an instinct, but he is equally eager that,
like other human instincts, its action should be determined
by intelligence. In describing the “Plan” for
his Kindergarten, Froebel pleads for more careful
observation of the child and his relationships, and
says that “thereby”:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Deeper insight will be gained into the meaning
and importance of the child’s actions and
outward manifestations and also into the way of
dealing with children which has been evolved
naturally by the mother led by her pure maternal
instinct.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 248.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As to the early beginnings of the instinct in the
little girl we can find just a few references, sufficient
to show that it did not pass unnoticed, and it seems
here legitimate to say that “the girl anticipates her
destiny,” as Froebel does in speaking of doll-play,
though certainly this does not cover all such play:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The joy of the child in its doll has a far deeper
human foundation than is generally supposed&mdash;a
foundation by no means resting merely in the
external resemblance … the girl anticipates her
destiny&mdash;to foster Nature and life.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 93.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>The boy’s destiny is “to penetrate and rule Nature,”
so in the “Mother Songs” Froebel describes how the
boy is “cowering that no sign of life in the chicken
family may escape him, while the girl starts up, <em>all her
care of things stirred</em>, in order to beckon or call the hen
or cock not to forget their chickens.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 143.</cite></p>

<p>In all his writings, Froebel refers to how much he
has learned from mothers: “It was in watching your
clever mother-doings that I learnt.” But, as he says
of himself, it was “a necessary part of me to be
irresistibly driven to search out the ultimate or primary
cause of every fact of life,” and so he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The natural mother does all this instinctively
without instruction or direction; but this is not
enough: it is needful that she should do it consciously,
as a conscious being acting upon another
which is growing into consciousness, and consciously
tending toward the continuous development
of the human being.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 64.</cite></p>

<p>“Motherly and womanly instinct does much
of its own accord; but it often makes mistakes.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 63.</cite></p>

<p>“Women’s work in education must be based
not upon natural instinct, so often perverted or
misunderstood, but upon intelligent knowledge.…
Some mothers level the taunt at me that
I, a man, understanding nothing of a mother’s
instinct, should dare to presume to instruct
mothers in their dealings with their own children.…
How could such a thought enter my head
as to attempt anything against the course of
Nature? My whole strength is exerted on the
contrary, to the work of getting the natural instinct
and its tendencies more rightly understood,
and more acknowledged; so that women may
follow its leadings as truly as possible aided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the higher light of intelligent comprehension, and
yet at the same time in all freedom, and with
complete individuality.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 259.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>So, in what he says of this last instinct, Froebel
is faithful to what he has said of all human instincts.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Man shall assuredly not neglect his natural
instincts, still less abandon them, but he must
ennoble them through his intelligence and purify
them through his reason.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smcap">Play and Its Relation to Work</span></h2>

<p>To write even a small book on Froebel without
directly touching on the subject of play would
be impossible, though in dealing with instincts and
the carrying out of natural activities we have
necessarily considered much that comes under this
heading.</p>

<p>On the educative value of play, Froebel is recognizedly
original, and his views have influenced and are
influencing schools for young children in most civilized
countries. Indeed, it would be difficult to show that
modern writers on play, in spite of the scientific
thoroughness of their investigations, classifications and
terminology, have made much advance upon Froebel’s
theories. Rather do they tend to show how remarkable
was his insight, and how surprisingly well grounded
his theories.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, has yet been said as to the
relation of play to work, no direct definition has yet
been given, nor has any reference been made to the
now familiar theories of play.</p>

<p>In Froebel’s day, these, as clearly formulated
theories, were non-existent. His work was that of a
pioneer, and his theory might have been called that of
“Preparation through Recapitulation.” He would,
however, have allowed that play is sometimes, though
not always, recreative, and he makes clear the necessity
for what he calls “healthy vital energy” (gesunden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Lebensmuthe), but he would never have called this
mere “surplus energy,” because he thought it was not
more than was required:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The genuine schoolboy should be full of life
and spirit, strong in body and mind.… Would
that, in judging the power of children and boys,
we might never forget the words of one of our
greatest German writers: that there is a greater
advance from the infant to the speaking child than
there is from the schoolboy to a Newton! Now,
if the advance is greater, the power, too, must
be greater; this we should consider.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 134.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Ebers, the Egyptologist, tells us that when he was
a boy at Keilhau full provision was made for this
abounding energy. We read of walks long and short,
of botanizing and geologizing rambles, of climbing
trees and cliffs for birds’ eggs, of which only one might
be taken from a nest. We hear of Indian games out
of Fenimore Cooper’s Leatherstocking Tales, of classic
and other dramas on winter evenings, and of Homeric
battles, which Froebel, he says, would have called
“signs of creative imagination and individual life.”
There was swimming and skating and coasting and
“the spacious wrestling ground with the shooting stand
and the gymnasium for every spare moment of the
winter”; and a piece of ground “assigned to each
pupil, where he could wield spade and pickaxe, roll
stones, sow and reap.” But the great game was the
Bergwacht, where the boys, divided into four parties
that all might be active, actually constructed, and
then attacked and defended stone fortresses. “How
quickly,” says Ebers, “we learned to use the plummet,
to take levels, hew the stone and wield the axe.” The
weapons were blunted stakes. It was forbidden to
touch the head, but it was a point of honour among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the boys to yield as prisoner if touched by the pole,
“and what self-denial it required!” These combats
were held on fine Saturday evenings, and when all
was over “the women,” probably the girls of the
school community, had lighted fires and made supper
ready, and the lads slept in their fortresses while two
sentinels marched up and down, relieved every half-hour.
On the Sunday following the boys were not
required to go to church, “where we should merely
have gone to sleep.”</p>

<p>It has frequently been brought as an accusation
against Froebel that he makes no clear cut distinction
between work and play, and that is true, but who
nowadays does? Common sense would probably
join hands with the philosopher in saying that the
feeling of freedom is the chief distinction of play as
opposed to work, and this is the definition quite distinctly
given by Froebel. The definition is given in
his detailed enumeration of “the various directions of
an active life of instruction and education,” and after
mentioning religious training, cultivation of the body
as the means of expressing mind, the study of Nature,
etc., etc., he comes to:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play, that is, spontaneous representation and
exercise of every kind.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 236.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Another definition given in “The First Action of a
Child” is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play, which is independent outward expression
of what is within.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 29.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is because it is spontaneous that Froebel calls
play, during the period of earliest childhood, when the
child is gaining control of language, “the highest phase
of human development at this stage.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play and speaking form the element in which
the child lives at this time.… Play is the highest
stage of child-development, of human development
at this stage, because it is spontaneous (freithätige)
representation of the inner, representation of the
inner out of the need and desire of the inner
itself. This is implied in the very word Play.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 34.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>For modern views on play we turn to the exhaustive
study made by Karl Groos in his two volumes, “The
Play of Animals,” and “The Play of Man.” Here we
find the writer taking “the conception of impulse life
as a starting-point,” and reaching the conclusion “that
among higher animals certain instincts are present
which, especially in youth, but also in maturity, produce
activity that is without serious intent, and so
give rise to the various phenomena which we include
in the word ‘play.’” In this play, Groos goes on,
“opportunity is given to the animal through the
exercise of inborn dispositions, to strengthen and
increase his inheritance in the acquisition of adaptations
to his complicated environment, an achievement
which would be unattainable by mere mechanical
instinct alone.” In the treatment of human play he
considers “an analogous position is tenable,” but, for
the word instinct, with its particular reactions, he
must substitute “natural or hereditary impulse.”</p>

<p>We have already seen that though Froebel recognized
the existence and importance of human instinct,
still he distinguished between it and the “definite and
strong instincts” which belong to the animals lower
than man. We have seen that he regarded the play
of childhood as “spontaneous self-instruction” based
on the instincts of investigation and of construction or
representation, action being regarded as the principal
means of investigating, as well as of gaining control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
over the surroundings and over the self. We have
noticed, too, that Groos feels inclined to assume a
universal “impulse to activity,” and points out that
Ribot approaches such an assumption, though for himself
he can only venture to “hold fast to the fact of the
primal need for activity.” Froebel does, as we have
seen, attribute to the infant the one instinct of
activity, which in one place he calls “the natural
longing for some mode of activity inherent in all
children,” and this he says becomes differentiated at
a later period.</p>

<p>The special place given by Groos to imitation as
“the link between instinctive and intelligent conduct”
is also noteworthy. For we have seen that Froebel
regards imitation in precisely the same light, never
calling it an instinct, but saying that it is the outcome
of spontaneous activity, and that it leads on to
understanding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For what man tries to represent or do he
begins to understand.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 76.</cite></p>

<p>“As now, habit in the child proceeds from
spontaneous and independent activity, so also
does imitation; … the whole inner life of the
child shows itself as a tri-unity in the three-#fold
phenomenon of spontaneous activity, habit
and imitation.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 28.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to make plain how Froebel regarded
play, until it is known how he regarded work, work,
too, not only for a child but for a human being. What
he desired for all was work which produces joy; he
calls it “a debasing illusion that man works, produces,
creates, only in order to preserve his body, only to
secure food, clothing and shelter.” Man, he says, works
“primarily and in truth that his real essence may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
assume outward form,” and one of his sayings is that
“the true spirit of life is the genuine spirit of play.”
In an ideal state of affairs, no human being would
be condemned to entirely mechanical work. Work
“worthy of the nature of man” is to Froebel work
which in some way expresses the man; mechanical
work is dismissed as “degrading man into a beast
of burden or a machine.” It is because man is of
God that he must work, must produce. “Nearer we
hold of God who gives, than of his tribes who take,
I must believe,” is Froebel’s thought in Browning’s
words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Each thought of God is a work, an act, a
result.… God created man in His own image.
Therefore man must create and work like God.
Man’s spirit must hover over the unformed and
move it that figure and form may come forth.
This is the higher meaning, the deep significance,
the great purpose of work and industry, of working,
and, as it is truly significantly called, of creating.
We become like God by diligence and industry,
by work and action, which are accompanied by
the clear perception or even the least anticipation
that thereby we represent the inner by the outer;
that we give body to spirit and form to thought,
make visible the invisible, give an outward transient
existence to the eternal that lives in the spirit.…
Early work, guided in accordance with its
inner meaning, confirms and elevates religion.
Religion without work is apt to become empty
dreaming.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 30.</cite></p>

<p>“The boy is to take up his future work which
now has become his calling, not indolently in sullen
gloom, but cheerfully and joyously, trusting God,
himself and Nature, rejoicing in the manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
prosperity of his work.… Nor will the father
say that his son must take up his own business
… he will see that every business may be
ennobled and made worthy of man.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 233.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is too cheap a jibe to throw at Froebel and his
educational theories that he makes little distinction
between work and play. It ought never to come from
any one who has made even a slight study of
psychology. The sting is meant to lie in the suggestion
that play is trifling and easy and that it requires no
exertion, while work is serious and demands concentrated
effort, but this view will not bear any consideration.
Every one knows that the play even of an
adult, where the differentiation between work and play
ought to be more possible, is often most exhausting,
either to body or to mind. As to the play of childhood,
one of the best known passages in “The Education of
Man” is the one in which Froebel protests that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play at this time is not trivial, it is highly
serious and of deep significance.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 55.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is in this passage, too, that he speaks of the
child “wholly absorbed in play,” who after “playing
enduringly even to the point of fatigue” has fallen
asleep “while so absorbed,” and calls this “the most
beautiful expression of child-life at this stage.”</p>

<p>It is Froebel’s glory that as early as 1826 he had
applied the theory of development to education and,
rightly or wrongly, he believed that if we could but
supply to our school children material suited to their
needs according to their stage of development, they
would respond with the same eagerness that the younger
child shows in what we call his play, but what Froebel
called his “self-culture and self-education.” He states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
this view quite distinctly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have considered the object and aim of
human life in general.… It now remains to
show in what sequence and connection the life
impulses of the boy develop at this stage, how and
in what order and form, the school should work
in order to satisfy human instincts in general, and
especially the instincts of the boy at this stage of
school-life.</p>

<p>“From a consideration of <em>the means of instruction
and manner of teaching thereby conditioned,
which necessarily coincide with the striving of man
toward development</em>, what is necessary for the
knowledge of number, of space, of form, of exercises
in speech, of writing and of reading comes
out clearly and definitely.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 229.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The view that “the material of instruction and the
manner of teaching” are necessarily conditioned by
the child’s stage of development is a view that has
rapidly gained ground. Froebel did his best to apply
it, and it had a partial application in the “culture
epochs” theory of the Herbartians. It has received a
stronger impetus into what seems at present a much
truer direction, from the experimental work carried out
at Chicago, under the auspices of Professor Dewey.
Froebel maintained that it was a condition of satisfactory
work in every subject. For example, in connection
with the teaching of writing he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here, as in all instruction, we should start
from a definite need of the boy, a need, which
must, to a certain extent, have been previously
developed, if he is to be taught with profit and
success. This is the source of a multitude of
imperfections in our schools, that we teach without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
having awakened any need for it, nay even after
having repressed what need was already there!
How can instruction and the school prosper?”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 223.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel speaks in the same way of work in colours,
saying “children feel the need of a knowledge of
colours.” Of poetry in general, including religious
verses and prayers, he says “these must be given
according to the requirements of the development of
the child’s mind, and must give expression to what
is already there.”</p>

<p>Returning now to the subject of play as such, we
find that Groos retains as “general psychological
criteria of play,” but two “of the elements popularly
regarded as essential&mdash;namely, its pleasurableness, and
the actual severance from life’s serious aims.” Of these
he says: “Both are included in activity performed for
its own sake.”</p>

<p>It is in connection with very young children that
Froebel speaks of activity for its own sake, and here
he does not differentiate between work and play. He
is true to his theory that in all things capable of development,
“what is definite proceeds everywhere from what
is indefinite.” So he says that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play is at first just natural life.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 54.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>He maintains that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The activity of the senses and limbs is the
first germ or bud, and play, building and shaping
(Gestalten) the first tender blossoms of the formative
instinct, and that this is the point of time,
at which man is to be prepared for future industry,
diligence, and productive activity.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 34.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>But, in the case of the boy a little older, though
still only seven or eight, Froebel does distinctly differentiate,
giving the definition of play already quoted,
“spontaneous expression and practice of every kind,”
and saying of work, that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Boys of this age should have definite domestic
occupations, indeed they could be actually instructed
by mechanics and farmers as has already
been done by many a father with active natural
insight. Boys of a somewhat advanced age should
be often placed in a position to accomplish something
with their own hands and their own judgment
… should devote daily at least one or two
hours to an occupation with outward results …
after such a refreshing <em>work bath</em>, I cannot better
designate it, the mind goes with new life to its
intellectual employments.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 236.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Of the infant, Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At this stage of development the man-to-be
(dem erschienenen werdenden Menschen) <em>uses his
body, his senses, his limbs, entirely for that use,
practice and exercise, not at all for its results</em>, to
which he is quite indifferent, or, to speak more
correctly, of which he has as yet no idea. Out of
this comes what begins at this stage, the child’s
play with his limbs; with his hands, fingers, lips,
tongue and feet, and also with the movements of
his eyes and of his face.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 48.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Of the older child Froebel very distinctly insists
that he wants more than the activity, that he wants
outward result. But the result of which he speaks is
one which Groos himself would not disallow. It is
only the outward product of the impulse which has
been gratified, a result which is present to the mind
of the older child, while to the infant no such consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
is possible.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What at an earlier stage of childhood was
action for the sake of the activity, is now, in the
boy, activity for the sake of the visible result;
the child’s instinct of activity has developed into
an instinct for shaping or giving form, and herein
lies the solution of the whole outer life or outer
manifestation of boy life at this stage.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 99.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Inquiring into the kind of pleasure derived from
play, Groos finds that it rests primarily on the satisfaction
of inborn impulses, which press for discharge,
and he gives three special “inborn necessities which
ground our pleasure in play&mdash;namely, the exercise of
attention, the demand to be an efficient cause, and
imagination.”</p>

<p>As to attention, he suggests that it lends a meaning
to the vague idea of a general need for activity,
speaking of “the pitiable condition of boredom” if
opportunity is withheld.</p>

<p>Froebel, of course, has much to say about the
instinct of activity, or, as he usually calls it in “The
First Action of a Child,” the instinct of employment
(Beschäftigungstrieb), which is noticeable “even when
the so-called three months’ slumber has just ended.”
He, too, frequently refers to “the ennui and pernicious
lack of occupation,” to the “mischievous
idleness which results from our not satisfying or
misdirecting the natural longing for activity inherent
in all children.” It is because Froebel’s thoughts
always run on conscious revelation of the self within
as the explanation of human life, that he makes so
much of “the child’s instinct to employ itself”
(Triebe des Kindes, sich zu beschäftigen). This
also explains how so much that he says corresponds
with what Groos brings forward with regard to “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
joy in being a cause,” and its modifications. These
modifications are (<i>a</i>) pleasure in the mere possession
of power, (<i>b</i>) emulation, when a model is copied, and
(<i>c</i>) in the case of imitative competition there is
pleasure in surpassing others as well as the enjoyment
of success resulting from that pleasure of overcoming
difficulties which comes under the combative instinct.</p>

<p>Froebel is warning parents that they must provide
for their children opportunity for the exercise of the
impulse to formative activity by letting them help,
even if their help is really a hindrance, and he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If his earlier activity was only imitation of
what he saw around him, now it is sharing in the
business of the house, lifting, pulling, carrying,
digging, and wood-splitting. In everything the
boy will exercise, measure and compare his
strength that his body may grow stronger, <em>that
his power may increase, and that he may know
its measure</em>.… At this age the healthy boy,
brought up simply and naturally, never avoids a
difficulty, never goes round a hindrance: no, he
seeks it out and overcomes it. ‘Let it lie,’
calls the vigorous youngster to the father, who
offers to remove an obstacle; ‘Let it lie: I can
get over it.’ … As activity gave pleasure to
the child, so work gives pleasure to the boy.
Hence the daring feats of boyhood.… Easy is
the most difficult, without peril the most adventurous,
for the impulse comes from the innermost
nature, from his heart and will.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 101.</cite></p>

<p>“But it is not only the impulse to use and to
measure his power that urges the boy to roam and
to climb&mdash;it is the need to widen his mental
horizon.… The same desire holds him to the
plain … he occupies himself with water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
with plastic materials. For he seeks now <em>because
of the feeling of power over material already gained</em>
to master these. Everything must serve his
impulse towards construction.… And so each
forms for himself his own world, <em>for the feeling
of his own power demands his own space and his
own material</em>.…”&mdash;<cite>E., pp. 102-107.</cite></p>

<p>“But all the plays and occupations of boys do
not by any means aim at representing objects and
things. On the contrary, <em>in many pure exercise of
strength and measuring of strength predominate</em>,
and many have no further aim than the display
of strength. Yet the play of this age has always
its peculiar characteristic, namely, as during the
period of childhood, the aim of play consisted
simply in activity as such, so now its aim is always
a definite conscious purpose, which characteristic
develops more and more as the boys increase in
age. This is observable even with all games of
bodily movement, of running, boxing, wrestling,
with ball-games, goal, hunting, and war games,
etc.”</p>

<p>“<em>It is the sense of sure and reliable power, the
sense of its increase</em> both as an individual and as a
member of the group <em>that fills the boy with all-pervading
jubilant joy</em> during these games.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 113.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is evidently difficult even for practised thinkers
to grasp the importance of what we so glibly call play
in the case of the young child. Mr. Kirkpatrick, for
instance, fully recognizes its importance in regard to
children somewhat older, and he makes a suggestive
distinction between play and amusement, calling play
active, while amusement is passive. Others, he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
work for our amusement. But when he speaks of the
infant, he slips into the mistake of saying that the
infant, even though active, “amuses” itself. To the
ordinary observer the whole life of a young child is
play, but it would be as correct to say that it is all
work.</p>

<p>Professor Stout, true to what he calls the tendency
of the moderns to see in the little child what is writ
large in the adult, allows “purely intellectual curiosity”
on the part of the infant. We have no right to call an
infant passive and therefore amused even when the
mother shakes the rattle for his edification. He may
be striving hard to accommodate his organs of sight,
he may be recalling previous sounds similar and dissimilar,
he may be watching and comparing different
movements and different positions. He has so much
to learn “with the world so new and all,” and, to judge
from his seriousness, it is at times a most momentous
inquiry. The baby to whom the activity of throwing
is new, and who spends full twenty minutes in
throwing a tram ticket on the floor of the car&mdash;which
the patient mother restores each time&mdash;throwing, too,
with such force and evident purpose, cannot properly
be said to be playing. Nor can the infant who stares
with such concentration at the lighted lamp and who,
when the mother moves out of the direct range of
the light, strives with all its feeble strength to readjust
its position to that entrancing brightness.</p>

<p>Of the very young child, Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first voluntary employments of the child
are observation of its surroundings, spontaneous
taking in of the outer world, and play, which is
independent outward expression … it is evident
therefore how important is the training … and
also the kind of voluntary playful occupation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the child.… For as the life of man is continuous
one can recognize even in the first baby
life, though only in the slightest traces and most
delicate germs, all the mental activities which in
later life become predominant.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 29.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>When Groos reaches the pedagogical standpoint, he
says:</p>

<p>“We have repeatedly found in the course of this
inquiry that even the most serious work may include
a certain playfulness, especially when enjoyment of
being a cause and of conquest are prominent. Between
flippant trifling, and conscientious study there is a
wide chasm which nothing can bridge, but not all play
is such trifling. Who would forbid the teacher’s
making the effort to induce in his pupils a psychological
condition like that of the adult worker, who is not
oppressed by the <em>shall</em> and <em>must</em> in the pursuit of his
calling, because the very exertion of his physical and
mental powers in work, involving all his capabilities,
fills his soul with joy? Since play thus approaches
work, when pleasure in the activity as such, as well
as its practical aim, becomes a motive power (as in
the gymnastic games of adults), so may work become
like play, when its real aim is superseded by enjoyment
of the activity itself. And it can hardly be
doubted that this is the highest and noblest form of
work.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is beyond dispute that this is the kind of work
that Froebel desired for all humanity, so it is not
surprising if he drew no hard and fast line between
work and the “<em>play</em>” which he insists “<em>is not trivial</em>,”
and which he urges parents to protect and guide. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
play at the stage of boyhood he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Joy is the soul of every activity at this
period.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 304.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And in reference to the right kind of instruction he
says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The union of school and life is the first and
indispensable requirement … if men are ever to
free themselves from the oppressive burden and
emptiness of merely extraneously communicated
knowledge, heaped up in memory, if they would
ever rise to the joy and vigour of a knowledge of
the real nature of things, to a living knowledge of
things.… Mankind is meant to enjoy a degree
of knowledge and insight, of energy and efficiency,
of which at present we have no conception; for
who has measured the limits of God-born mankind!
The boy is to take up his work which
has now become his calling, not indolently in
sullen gloom, but cheerfully and joyously.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
pp. 230-233.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>One distinct line of division is that drawn by Groos
when he says that with young animals and probably
with children “their first manifestation of what is
afterwards experimentation, fighting and imitative play,
etc., is rarely conscious, and therefore we cannot assert
with assurance that it is pleasurable.”<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In this case
he says the biological but not the psychological germ
of play is present. Froebel never lost sight of the
psychological point of view in so far as his desire always
was to see what the action meant to the actor, what
the child’s play meant to the child, and also in that
he desired all the activity to be joyous, to be performed
for its own sake. But it was really the biological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
view that he endeavoured to reach and to set forth.</p>

<p>Coming now to the Theories of Play, it seems clear
that, if he had ever heard of them, Froebel would
have endeavoured to combine those of Recapitulation
and Preparation. He states quite plainly that these
are not incompatible, recognizing that in any work
or play, by which the child retraces past stages of
human development, he gains what is most necessary
for his own future life, control over his surroundings
as well as over himself, something after the manner in
which these have been gained by the race.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The observation of the development of individual
man and its comparison with the general
development of the human race show plainly that,
in the development of the inner life of the individual
man, the history of the mental development
of the race is repeated, and that the race in its
totality may be viewed as one human being, in
whom there will be found the necessary steps in
the development of individual man.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 160.</cite></p>

<p>“Indeed each successive generation and each
successive individual human being, inasmuch as he
would understand the past and present, must pass
through all preceding phases of human development
and culture, and this should not be done in
the way of dead imitation, or mere copying, but
in the way of spontaneous self-activity.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 18.</cite></p>

<p>“Man should, at least mentally, repeat the
achievements of mankind, that they may not be
to him empty dead masses, that his judgment of
them may not be external and spiritless; he
should mentally go over the ways of mankind,
that he may learn to understand them. However
it may be said of this growing activity of boyhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which by spirit and law are destined for a conscious
aim, ‘My son does not require this.’ Perhaps you
are right, I do not know, but you do know that
your sons need energy, judgment, perseverance,
prudence, etc., and that these things are indispensable
to them; and all these things they are
sure to get in the course indicated.…”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 282.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is often said that traditional games are mere
survivals, degenerate imitations of ancient customs, and
therefore not worth encouraging. But children are not
bound by tradition, and Froebel is probably right when
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is my firm conviction that whenever you
find anything that gives children lastingly and ever
freshly a joy belonging to a true pure life&mdash;anything
where innocence and mirth predominate&mdash;you
have found something which has at the bottom
of it a higher and more important meaning for a
child’s life.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 172.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>We cannot always tell why children enjoy the game,
or what they gain from it. Such games are at least
the earliest and simplest introduction to “the rules of
the game,” and they contain the elements of choosing
sides and of whispered secrets. These things may seem
small to the ordinary onlooker, but not to the real
observer, who sees the amount of self-control required
by a child of four or five, that he may not proclaim
the secret aloud, the difficulty he has in whispering,
and the importance to him of the choice between
oranges and lemons or whatever it may be. There
are certainly some which most thinking persons,
Froebelian or otherwise, would wish to discourage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
As Froebel himself said of some that he found in use:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thought some were too empty and silly and
some said a great deal that I would not willingly
have said to children. Yet the counting games
themselves seemed to me important in many ways,
as I hope will appear from comparing the way I
have dealt with them, and above all, as the mottoes
are meant to point out. I even wished to keep the
sound of the well-known popular words, at least
in the opening words.…”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 157.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Certainly, Froebel would have had no dealings with
either work or play which would interfere with progressive
development, he wanted recapitulation because
he regarded that “great necessary highway” as the
road to sure progress.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Only if in each particular we tread again the
great necessary highway of humanity as a whole,
does the great and vigorous early life of humanity
come back to us in and through the children.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 222.</cite></p>

<p>“Education must be much more tolerating<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and
following than predetermining and prescribing, for
by the full application of the latter method of instruction
we should entirely lose the characteristic,
the sure and steady progressive development of
mankind.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 10.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Some educators who have made much of the
“culture epochs” might have avoided mistakes and
exaggerations if they had taken to heart Froebel’s
repeated warning that the child has “living relations”
not only with the past, but with the future, besides being
at the same time the child of the present generation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Parents should view their child in his necessary
connection, in his obvious and living relations to
the past, present, and future development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
humanity, in order to bring the education of the
child into harmony with the past, present and
future requirements of the development of
humanity and of the race.… Man, humanity
in man, as an external manifestation, should therefore
be looked upon not as perfectly developed,
not as fixed and stationary, but as steadily and
progressively growing, in a state of ever-living
development, ever ascending from one stage of
culture to another toward its aim, which partakes
of the infinite and eternal.</p>

<p>“It is unspeakably pernicious to look upon the
development of humanity as stationary and completed
and to see in its present phases only
repetitions and greater generalizations of itself.
For the child, as well as every successive generation,
becomes thereby exclusively imitative, an
external dead copy&mdash;a cast, as it were, of the
preceding, and not a living ideal of the stage
which it has attained in human development
considered as a whole, to serve future generations
in all time to come.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 17.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Underlying all that Froebel has to say of play,
is the idea that it is a preparation for future life
activities. This is implied even in the definition
given of the play of the child of three years old, viz.
that it is “spontaneous self-instruction”; it is most
evident in the passage:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play, building and modelling are the first
tender blossoms, and this is the period when man
is to be prepared for future industry, diligence
and productive activity.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 34.</cite></p>

<p>“The whole later life of man has its source in
the period of childhood, be this later life bright or
gloomy, gentle or violent, industrious or lazy, rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
or poor in action, passed in dull stupor or in keen
creativeness, in stupid wonder or in intelligent
insight, productive or destructive.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 55.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Of his later institution, the Kindergarten, Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great end and aim of the whole undertaking
is the Education of Man from its earliest
beginning, by means of action, feeling, and thought,
in accordance with his own inward being and outward
relations, … <em>this to be attained by</em> the right
care of child-life, <em>the encouragement of childish
activities</em>.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 164.</cite></p>

<p>“For the object is twofold: Firstly the realization
in as clear and perfect a manner as possible,
of <em>the fundamental conception of a mode of education</em>
based upon the early and complete training of
human life, and <em>satisfying the needs of children by
a genuine encouragement of their spontaneous
activity</em> through the medium of a normal institution
which we have symbolically named a
Kindergarten.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 166.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>About the play of boyhood Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Play to the boy is a mirror of the combat of
life awaiting him in the future: therefore, in order
to strengthen himself for the combat, the human
being both in early and later boyhood seeks out
obstacles, difficulty and combat in his play.…
Many of his actions have an inner significance.…
How wholesome it would be if parents and
child, for their present and future, if parents believed
in this, if they would observe the life of their
children in this respect, what a new living bond
would unite parents and child, what a new thread
of life would be drawn between their present and
their future life!”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 118.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p>Of his own Keilhau boys he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One thing is certain, these plays are the
outcome of the spirit of boyhood. And the boys
who played thus were good scholars, intelligent,
and willing to learn, seeing and expressing clearly,
diligent and full of zeal. Some are now capable
young men with well trained heads and hearts,
quick in expedients and dexterous in action; some
are capable, clear-sighted men, and others will
become so.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 111.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In America at least the authorities are beginning
to realize the truth of Froebel’s words as to the importance
of playgrounds, and actual experiment has
shown that he was right in saying that “even the
plays should be under right guidance,” not for purposes
of repression, but for the encouragement of real
play which “must necessarily break forth in joy from
within.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Justice, moderation, self-control, truthfulness,
loyalty, brotherly feeling and again, strict
impartiality&mdash;who, when he approaches a group
of boys engaged in such games, could fail to
catch the fragrance of these delicious blossomings
of the heart and mind and of a firm will; not to
mention the beautiful, though perhaps less fragrant,
blossoms of courage, perseverance, resolution,
prudence, together with the severe elimination
of indolent indulgence? Flowers of still more
delicate fragrance bloom … forbearance, consideration,
sympathy and encouragement for the
weaker, younger and more delicate; fairness to
those who are as yet unfamiliar with the game.</p>

<p>“Would that all who, in the education of boys,
barely tolerate playgrounds might consider these
things! There are, indeed, many harsh words and
many rude deeds, but the sense of power must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
needs precede its cultivation. Keen, clear and
penetrating are the boy’s eyes; keen and decided
therefore, even harsh and severe is his judgment
of those who are his equals, or who claim equality
with him in judgment and power.</p>

<p>“Every place should have its own common
playground for the boys. Glorious results would
come from this for the entire community. For
at this period, games, whenever it is feasible, are
common, and thus develop the feeling and desire
for community and the laws and requirements of
community.</p>

<p>“The boy tries to see himself in his companions,
to feel himself in them, to weigh and measure
himself by them, to know and find himself with
their help. Thus the games directly influence and
educate the boy for life, awaken and cultivate
many civil and moral virtues.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 113.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It was in watching boys one day&mdash;“boys,” he says,
“of the right age for these plays, but whose life is not
awakened, or has been dulled, and who now idly lounge
around, getting in their own way, as it were”&mdash;that a
friend said to him, “I do not understand how these
boys cannot play, how many plays we had at their
age!” And it is here that Froebel gives his version
of the “surplus energy” theory when he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In every case the plays of this age are or
should be pure manifestations of strength and
vitality, they are the product of fullness of life, and
of pleasure in life. They presuppose actual vigour
of life, both inner and outer. Where these are
lacking, there cannot be true play, which, bearing
life in itself, awakens, nourishes and heightens
life.… This shows clearly that even the plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
at this age should be under guidance<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>, and the
boy made ready for them, i.e. his life, his experience
both in school and out of it, must be
made so rich that it must necessarily break forth
in joy from within, like the blossom from the
swelling bud. Joy is the soul of every activity of
boyhood at this period.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 303.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is here, too, in the section entitled, “Play or
Spontaneous Expression and Practice of Every Kind”
that Froebel begins a general classification of boy’s
play:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The plays, or spontaneous occupations, of
this age are of three kinds, they are either (<i>a</i>)
imitations of life, or (<i>b</i>) spontaneous applications
of what has been learned, or they are (<i>c</i>) perfectly
spontaneous expression with all kinds of material.
These last are either governed by the material,
or by the thought and feeling of the human being.…
They may be and are either Physical plays,
exercising strength and dexterity, or else mere
buoyancy of life; or Sense plays exercising the
hearing, e.g. in hiding games, etc., or the sight,
as in shooting plays or colour plays, etc.; or Intellectual
plays, games of reflection and judgment,
e.g. draughts, etc. As such they are already
arranged, but the true aim and spirit of the play
is rarely understood and the games are seldom
managed according to the needs of the boy.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 304.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This general classification is very much the same
as that of Groos, who divides Play first into two main
classes, viz. Playful Experimentation and Playful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Exercise of the Second or Socionomic Order. Under
the first heading come I. Playful Activity of the Sensory
Apparatus; II. Playful Use of the Motor Apparatus;
and III. Playful Exercise of the Higher Mental Powers.
The first two correspond to Froebel’s Sense Plays and
Physical Plays, and the third to his Intellectual Plays.
Under the second heading, Groos brings Fighting
Plays, which as we have seen Froebel attributes to the
unconscious desire to measure and increase strength;
Imitative Play, which to Froebel is the child’s way of
learning by action; Love Plays of which Froebel takes
no notice at all, and Social Play. Under this comes
what has been given as to the importance of Playgrounds,
and much of what Froebel wrote as to the
Kindergarten Games. For instance, as part of the
work of the students in his Training Course comes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The acquisition of little games arranged to
exercise the limbs and senses of the child.…
The acquisition of other games arranged to suit
special ends and suited to varied grades of development.…
Practice in combined games for many
children, and particularly action games, which
will, from the first, train the child (by his very
nature eager for companionship) in the habit of
association with comrades, that is, in good fellowship
and all that this implies.… To games for
individual children succeed games for the whole
Kindergarten together. The child in these associated
games alternately appears first as taking
some individual or separate part, and then as
merely one of several closely knit and equally
important members of a greater whole, so that he
becomes familiar with both the strongly opposed
elements of his life; namely the individual
determining and directing side, and the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
ordered and subordinated side.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 253.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Games of this kind have been much misused,
especially by being given a rigidity of form which,
Froebel wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Would quite destroy that fresh merry life which
should animate the games … the games would
cease to be games and lose their full educational
power. The main thought must be held fast;
but the precise form and style in which the games
are played must be the outcome of the moment.
The freer and more spontaneous the arrangement,
the more excellent is the effect of the game.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 85.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The number and variety of plays and games noted
by Froebel is quite surprising. Of the long list given
by Groos there are few indeed which he does not
mention.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The plays for older children are given in
“The Education of Man,” but other games encouraged
at Keilhau are to be found in the accounts
given by Ebers. Even in his earlier work Froebel
shows how closely he had been observing the play of
little children, but this he worked out later in his
Mother Songs, in the papers on his various “Gifts,”
and in that on Movement Play. These later books
were written and the play material was planned because
Froebel saw that the children who do not play are
those “in whom life has not awakened or has been
dulled,” just because “the true aim and the spirit of
play is rarely understood and the games are seldom
managed according to the needs of the boy.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smcap">Froebel’s Play-Material and its Original
Purpose</span></h2>

<p>To one who believed, as Froebel did, that “the
means by which the child gains his first ideas
of his own nature and life and the nature and life
of the cosmos, are his play and playthings,” these
playthings could not be indifferent.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has been stated as a fundamental truth
that the plays and occupations of children should
by no means be treated as offering merely means
for passing, we might say for consuming, time,
hence as mere outer activity, but rather that by
means of such plays and employments the child’s
innermost nature must be satisfied.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 108.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel was speaking of his own Play-material&mdash;known
by the name of “Froebel’s Gifts” because he
thought them the most suitable gifts for little children&mdash;when
he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To realize his aims, man, and more particularly
the child, requires material, though it be
only a bit of wood or a pebble with which he makes
something or which he makes into something.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 235.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And although his opinion of the importance of that
particular series of playthings, which he chose from
among those he saw in general use, may have been
exaggerated, still there is a good deal of sound psychology
in what he says about them. In speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
imitative action and construction, we have already
touched upon what were perhaps the most important
ideas underlying this series.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What presents are most prized by the child?
Those which afford him a means of unfolding his
inner life most freely and of shaping it in various
directions.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 142.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>But Froebel also writes of his Gifts that “they
will cover the whole ground of training in sense
perception,” and he has managed to think out a very
fair number of the points which Dr. Ward, in his
Analysis of Perception, notes as important.</p>

<p>One of Froebel’s frequent Reviews of his play-material
begins:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How has the child developed up to this
point? How has the world, the objects and
things around him developed? How has the
child developed himself <em>especially through the toys</em>&mdash;the
means of play and employment&mdash;which
have thus far been given him? The brightening
light in the child’s mind illuminates the objects
around him. In proportion as the inner light
increases, the nature of external objects grows
clear to him … the law of development is that
of progress from the unlimited to the limited,
from the whole to the part, from an undifferentiated
to a membered totality … the outer
world comes to meet the inner world, it does
not hinder, but helps the inner world.</p>

<p>“The man advanced in insight should be clear
about all this before he introduces his child to the
outer world. Even when he gives his child a
plaything he must make clear to himself its purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and the purpose of playthings and occupation
material in general. This purpose is to aid the
child freely to express what lies within him&mdash;to
bring the phenomena of the outer world nearer
to him, and thus to serve as mediator between
the mind and the world.”&mdash;<cite>P., pp. 169-171.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Then Froebel explains in so many words the really
psychological aim or meaning of his sequence of
“Gifts,” so well known by name&mdash;and even better
known in most <em>un</em>-psychological practice&mdash;but little
understood in their real and original significance, as
a means of perception, the earlier ones at least, for
children much below even Kindergarten age.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Recognizing the mediatorial character of play
and playthings, we shall no longer be indifferent
either to the choice, the succession, or the organic
connection of the toys we give children. In these
I offer them, I shall consider as carefully as possible,
how the child may in using them develop
his nature freely and yet in accordance with law
(laws of mind), and how through such use he may
also learn to apprehend external things correctly
and to employ them justly. As the child’s first
consciousness of self was born of physical opposition
to and connection with the external
world, so through play with the ball, the external
world itself began to rise out of chaos and to
assume definiteness. In recognizing the ball the
child moved from the indefinite to the definite,
from the universal to the particular, from mere
externality (compare Prof. Ward’s ‘mere thing
stuff’) to a self-included space-filling object. In
the ball, especially through movement, through the
opposition of rest and motion, through departing
and returning, the object came forth out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
general space as a special space-filling object, as a
body: just as the child by means of his life
(activity) also perceives himself, his bodily frame,
as a space-filling object, as a body. The child has
thus obtained two important terms of comparison
for his first intellectual development; body and
body, object and object.… At the same time
there begins in the child, as in a seed-corn,
a development advancing towards manifoldness.
For this reason he should receive a corresponding
seed-corn in the object which he first detaches as
object from the external chaos. Such object
should, like himself, include an indefinite manifoldness,
and be susceptible of a progressive
development. Such an object is the ball (Gift I).”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 171.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The very first “intimation of an intellect,” Froebel
writes, is when the child is seen to “keep his gaze fixed
upon the motion of a bright object. This begins a
few weeks after birth.” The ball is to be given to the
baby “when the starting-point of recognition and
knowledge (Erkennens und Erkenntniss), viz. perceiving,
noticing, thinking (das Gewahrwerden, das
Bemerken und Beachten) becomes perceptible”: when
the child “can freely move its little arms and hands,
when it can perceive and distinguish tones, and can
turn its attention and gaze in the direction from which
these tones come.”</p>

<p>In his analysis of Perception, Dr. Ward distinguishes
(i) Assimilation or Recognition, (ii) Localization or
Spatial Fixation, and (iii) Objective Reference, or
Intuition of Things. Of these, the first, Assimilation,
has already been taken up in Chapter IV, and we have
seen that, according to Dr. Ward, it involves Retention
and Differentiation, though in itself there is no active
comparison, and we have seen that Froebel also spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the earliest impressions as “almost imperceptible,
but <em>fixed</em> by repetition and by change,”<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and of a
“perception of sequence” involving “dim” or “unconscious
comparison.”</p>

<p>Of the second process Dr. Ward writes: “To treat
of the localization of impressions is really to give an
account of the steps by which the psychological individual
comes to a knowledge of space,” and he goes on
to say that psychologists may have been too apt to
examine “the conception of space and not our concrete
space perceptions.” Now Froebel did consider concrete
space perception, and with a certain amount of
care. That he saw its importance is clear from the
fact that in discussing his “means of employment”
he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They will cover the whole ground of training
in sense perception but <em>will begin with the observation
of space and the knowledge that comes from
that, since the child first feels and finds himself in
space and finds others occupying space around him</em>.
They are to go on by development of limbs and
senses and by means of language to understand
Nature in all directions, so that finally man <em>who
at first could find himself only in space and by means
of space</em>, may learn to know himself as an existent,
feeling, thinking, intelligent, rational being, and
as such to try to live.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 19.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>And although Froebel may not fully have realized
that, as Dr. Ward puts it: “The infant’s earliest lessons
in spatial perception are in exploring his limbs,” still
we do find him writing from Blankenburg, in a letter
accompanying the first sketch of his Nursery Songs:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I soon felt that some important connecting
link was imperatively required to prepare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
newly awakening life of a child for its later
activity with the ball. It was through the ball
itself that I discovered this link: in general
terms it may be described as <em>the first development
of muscular movement and sensation</em> specially distinguishing
infancy. The link between the infant,
still an undivided self-sufficient whole of peaceful
life, and the ball, which is something external
given to him to play with, lies in the child’s own
limbs, the child’s own senses; and <em>the first toys
and occupations of the child come from himself;
he plays with his own limbs</em>, and uses them as
the material for representing his ideas. This
spontaneous activity of limb and vividness of
sensation natural to infancy must also be studied;
for a considerable degree of cultivation of these
powers is already necessary in the use of the
ball, etc.… To help the child to use his own
body, his limbs and sensations, and to assist
mothers to a consciousness of their duties …
I have carefully preserved several little songs and
games and send this collection to you for your
severe criticism.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;<cite>L., p. 108.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Having said that “the child first perceives himself,
his corporeal frame, as a space-filling object, as a body,
by means of his life,” or his activity, the first two of
this collection naturally deal with large body movements.
In the one the mother alternately lowers and
raises the infant, “letting him really feel a slight shock,”
and in the other the baby tramples with his feet, and
she is told to supply the object of resistance. This
resistance, as we have seen, gives him “the dim consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of self, which comes out of physical opposition
to, and connection with, the outer world,” which
Dr. Ward speaks of under the head of Localization of
Impressions. Dr. Ward writes that “the distinction
between his own and foreign bodies begins when the
child feels the difference between a series of movements
accompanied by passive touches, and one without
passive touches,” but Froebel goes no further than
noting what comes through “resistance.” The ball,
however, as we have just seen, is to be used so as to
assist the child’s comprehension of “a self-included
space-filling object,” and through play with the ball
he is to gain the “three great perceptions of object,
space and time.”</p>

<p>In the Intuition of things, Dr. Ward distinguishes
five points “concerning which psychology may be
expected to give an account: (<i>a</i>) the reality; (<i>b</i>)
solidity or occupation of space; (<i>c</i>) permanence, or,
rather, continuity in time; (<i>d</i>) unity and complexity;
and (<i>e</i>) substantiality and the connection of its attributes
and powers.”</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <em>Reality</em> he disposes of as “not strictly an item
by itself, but a characteristic of all the items that
follow.” Of (<i>b</i>), <em>Solidity or Impenetrability</em>, he writes
that “here our feelings of effort come specially into
play. They are not entirely absent in those movements
of exploration by which we attain a knowledge
of space; but it is when these movements are definitely
realized, or are only possible by increased effort, that
we reach the full meaning of body as that which
occupies space.” Dr. Ward goes on to add as “in the
highest degree essential,” that muscular effort should
meet with something which seems to be “making an
effort the counterpart of our own.”</p>

<p>Besides telling the mother to give the required
definite resistance, by opposing her hand or chest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the little trampling feet, Froebel gives a “new play, a
new perception of the object,” when he tells the mother
that “as soon as the child is sufficiently developed to
perceive the ball as a thing separate from himself,”
she should tie a string to it and pull gently.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child will hold the ball fast, the arm will
rise as you lift the ball, and as you loosen the
string the hand and arm will sink back from their
own weight; the feeling of the utterance of force,
as well as the alternation of the movement, will
delight the child. From this, however, soon
springs a quite new play, that is also something
new to the child, when, through a suitable drawing
and lifting, the ball escapes from the child’s hand
and then quietly moves freely before him as an
individual object. Through this play is developed
in the child a new feeling, the new perception of
the object as a something now clasped, grasped
and handled, and now as a freely active opposite
something.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 36.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><em>Unity and Complexity</em>, “the remaining factors in
the psychological constitution of things,” says Dr.
Ward, “might be described in general terms as the
time-relations of their opponents.…”</p>

<p>And Froebel, going straight on from “the opposite
something,” comes in like manner to time-relations.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One may say with deep conviction that even
this simple activity is inexpressibly important for
the child, for which reason it is to be repeated as
a play with the child as often as possible. What
the little one has up to this time directly felt so
often by the touch of the mother’s breast&mdash;union
and separation&mdash;it now perceives outwardly in an
object which can be grasped and clasped. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the repetition of this play confirms, strengthens,
and clears in the mind of the child a feeling and
perception deeply grounded in, and important to
the whole life of man&mdash;the feeling and perception
of oneness and individuality, and of disjunction
and separateness; also of present and past possession.…
The idea of return or recurrence soon
develops to the child’s perception, from the
presence and absence; that of reunion from the
singleness and separateness; of future repossession
from present and past possession, and so the
idea of being, having and becoming, are the dim
perceptions which first dawn on the child.</p>

<p>“From these perceptions there at once develop
in the child’s mind the three great perceptions of
object, space and time, which were at first one
collective perception. From the perceptions of
being, having and becoming in respect to space
and object, and in connection with them, there
soon develop also the new perceptions of present,
past and future in respect to time. Indeed, these
ninefold perceptions which open to the child the
portals of a new objective life, unfold themselves
most clearly by means of his constant play with
the one single ball.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 36.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ward gives as the first step “in the psychological
constitution of distinct things”&mdash;as opposed to
what he calls “mere thingstuff”&mdash;“the simultaneous
projection into the same occupied space of the several
impressions, which we thus come to regard as the
qualities of the body filling it.”</p>

<p>Froebel writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We gave, therefore, to the mother the brightly
coloured soft ball to make a unity of touch and
perception through sight, for through the brightness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
it makes itself known to sight, and through
warmth (softness?) to touch, as an objective
phenomena, a thing in itself.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 65.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To reach unity and complexity, says Ward, “it is
essential that objects should recur, and recur as they
have previously recurred, if knowledge is ever to
begin.” The constituent impressions must also “be
again and again repeated in like order to prompt anew
the same grouping,” and the constancy of one group
must present itself “along with changes in other
groups, and in the general field.… It is only where
a group, as a whole, has been found to change its
position relatively to other groups, and&mdash;apart from
causal changes&mdash;to be independent of changes of
position among them, that such complexes can become
distinct unities and yield a world of things.”</p>

<p>Froebel writes of one of his early plays:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is really important for the human being,
especially as a child, that the essential perceptions
of things should be <em>repeated frequently</em> under
different forms, and <em>if possible in a particular
order</em>, so that the child may easily learn to distinguish
the essential from the unessential and
accidental, and the abiding from the changing.
Unnoticed and unrecognized though the phenomena
are to the child, yet the impression of
them will be certain and firm, and this so much
the more when the repetition has been precise and
clear.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 88.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Later, speaking of a child’s earliest attempts at
walking, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The smallest child who begins to exercise the
power of walking, loves to go from place to place&mdash;i.e.
<em>he likes to turn about and to change the relationships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in which he stands to different objects, and in
which they stand to him. Through these changes he
seeks self-recognition and self-comprehension, as well
as recognition of the different objects which surround
him, and recognition of his environment as a whole</em>.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 243.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Ward requires still more and says that “the
unity of a thing” carries us over to temporal continuity,
and this he attributes to “the continuous
presentation of such a group as the bodily self, which
makes us infer continuity of existence, for presentations
which have been presented, removed and re-presented.”</p>

<p>We have seen already that Froebel says the child
perceives the ball “through departing and returning,
as a space-filling object, as a body, just as he perceives
himself, his corporeal frame, as a space-filling object,
as a body.” And there is also a quaint, but interesting
reference to something of this kind in one of the
earliest Nursery Songs called “All Gone,” where the
mother is distinctly told that she must help her child
to realize continuity through change.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How can the child understand what you mean
when you say ‘It’s all gone, Baby’? He will not
be contented unless you put meaning into it.
What he saw just now he sees no longer, what
was above is below, what was there is just now
vanished. Where, then, has it gone?”</p>

</div>

<p>And the baby is supposed to be quieted by the
mother’s playful tale of the present whereabouts of his
bread and milk, a German version of the homely
“Down red lane.”</p>

<p>Professor Ward’s last point in the intuition of
things is “substantiality.” “What is it,” he says,
“that has thus a beginning and continues indefinitely?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
The answer is that “of all the constituents
of things only one is universally present, that of
physical solidity, which presents itself according to
circumstances, as impenetrability, resistance or weight.…
In other words, that which occupies space is the
substantial; the other real constituents are but its
properties or attributes, the marks or manifestations
which lead us to expect its presence.”</p>

<p>Froebel, again, sums up the ideas he intends the
child to gain from play with the ball:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ball shows contents, mass, matter, space,
form, size and figure; it bears within itself an
independent power (elasticity) and hence it has
rest and movement, and consequently stability
and spontaneity; it offers even colour, and at
least calls forth sound; it is indeed heavy&mdash;that
is, it is attracted&mdash;and thus shares in the general
property of all bodies.… Therefore, it places
man, on his entrance into the world, furnished with
activity of limbs and senses, in the midst of all
phenomena and perceptions of Nature and of all
life … to place man through a skilful education
in the understanding of Nature and life, and to
maintain him in it with consciousness and circumspection
cannot be done too early.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 53.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The soft ball of the first gift is supposed to be
given to the child when he is three or even two months
old, but when he reaches six or eight months, he is
supposed to be ready for something which “makes
itself known especially through noise, sound, tone, as
it were through speech.” The second gift therefore
consists of a wooden sphere and a cube, which are
intended not only to please the child by the noise they
make, but to serve as material for comparison. The
mother is told to roll the sphere and then, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
make this oppositeness between sphere and cube perceptible
to the child, to place the cube steadily before
him and presently to take one of his little hands,
pushing gently at first, but</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“finally overcoming the gravity of the cube and
pushing it away with the child’s hand and fingers
… drawing the child’s strength, although yet so
feeble, into the play, that his limbs may be
trained, his strength increased, and that he may
experience and perceive much through his own
activity.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 77.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>By even these few representations the mother can
present to her child:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The quiet, firm sure-standing on a relatively
larger surface; the filling of space by each object;
heaviness which is expressed by pressure; the
final overcoming of heaviness (gravity); and the
possibility of moving away the body by the use of
a proportionately greater strength. The perception
of all these and many other facts, showing
themselves merely as changing phenomena in oft-recurring
repetition, will give pleasure even to the
child who is scarcely half a year, or at least not a
whole year old, especially when the play is placed
in intimate connection with the child’s life, and
with his impulse to activity.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 78.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Many plays are suggested, all to be accompanied
by song or rhyme, only, says Froebel, “one must not
go on in opposition to the wish of the child, but always
follow his requirements and needs and his own expressions
of life and activity.”</p>

<p>It is in this connection that Froebel notices how
early a child begins to note cause.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Even the child whose capacity for speech is
as yet undeveloped will remark the cause of the
fall of the cube, at least experience has shown us
that children of this age drew away the holding
support, and, as the cube then fell over, turned
toward their mother with face and body as in
joyous triumph.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 80.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The sphere and cube are also to be compared as to
shape:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Through all that has been done hitherto, the
child’s attention has been predominantly called to
the object, as filling space, and acting, but only
incidentally to the object as being the identical
one; nor yet to the figure and shape, nor to the
members and parts. But attention to the form
and figure of the object can also be utilized for
the child in play.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 83.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>So the mother is directed to hide the cube in her
hand and show it again&mdash;so that the child will watch
for its reappearance.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By this play the child is not only again
made to notice that the cube fills space, but his
attention is also called to its precise form; and
he will look at it sharply, <em>unconsciously comparing</em>
it with the hand to which his eyes were first
attracted.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 84.</cite></p>

<p>“Each object speaks constantly to man by its
qualities and attributes, and still more to the
child, though in mute speech.… It is essential
for the intellectual development of man that the
surroundings should speak to him by their qualities
and attributes.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 95.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Froebel’s “Gift III” is a little box containing
eight-inch cubes for building purposes, and after the
child has clearly gained the idea of “outer object”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let us first of all hasten to place ourselves
together in the children’s play corner, and there
seek to discover what attracts the child, or, rather,
in what direction he himself turns his attention,
what he would like to do and what he needs for
the purpose. Let us take our place there as
quietly and as unnoticed as possible, observing
how the child, between the ages of one and three
years, after he has clearly gained the idea of
“outer object,” has contemplated the form and
colour of the self-contained body which he can
handle, has moved it here and there in his hands,
and experimented upon its solidity, now tries to
pull it apart, or at least to alter its form in order
to discover new properties in it, and to find out
new ways of using it. If the little one succeeds
in his attempt to separate the object, we see that
he then tries to put the parts together, to form
the whole which he had at first, or to arrange
them in a new whole. We see that he will
unweariedly and quietly repeat this for a long
time.</p>

<p>“Let us linger over this significant phenomenon
and seek to recognize through it what we have to
furnish to the child from inner grounds and without
arbitrariness. This is: something firm which
can be easily pulled apart by the child’s strength,
and just as easily put together.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 117.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The time when the child wants this something to
arrange is given as any time “between the ages of
one and three.” It is the time when “his greatest
delight consists in the quick alternation of building
up and tearing down.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 106.</cite></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>At first the little one will be satisfied with arranging
and rearranging the cubes, piling them one
upon another, “placing one before, behind, beside
another.” Soon, however, he will try to make something
definite, and “the intelligent nurse interprets the
dim idea and sees whether a something, a table, a
chair, etc., can be perceived in what is represented.”
Then the something must have a purpose, so the chair
is grannie’s chair, the table is ready for the soup, and
so on.</p>

<p>There is nothing here which is not quite a usual
proceeding. Froebel’s peculiarity of treatment comes
from his desire to give the blocks to the child as a
whole which he can take to pieces. This is the reason
of the traditional proceeding, perhaps still kept up in
old-fashioned kindergartens, when the children first slip
the lid out a little way, then reverse the boxes, pull
out the lid and lift it off the box. The directions are
Froebel’s own, and are given:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“in order to furnish to the child at once clearly
and definitely, the impression of the whole, of
the self-contained; from this perception, as the
first fundamental perception (Grundanschauung)
all proceeds and must proceed.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 123.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is clear that this meaning is quite lost when the
same proceeding is forced on older children, who are
quite accustomed to pull down and build up.</p>

<p>Froebel emphasizes the fact that the pieces are of
the same cubical form as the whole thus presented,
and adds:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus fundamental perceptions, whole and
part, form, and size, are made clear by comparison
and contrast, as well as deeply impressed by
repetition.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 119.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>It is in speaking of this simplest of toys that
Froebel enters a strong protest against the complex
and useless toys which afford no scope for childish
activity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here, then, we meet a very great imperfection
and inadequateness&mdash;indeed in reference to
the inner development of the child an obstructing
element in that which is now so frequently provided
as a plaything for children; an element
which slumbers like a viper under roses&mdash;it is, in
a word, the already too complex and ornate, too-finished
plaything. The child can begin no new
thing with it, cannot produce enough variety by
means of it; his power of creative imagination,
his power of giving form to his own idea, are thus
actually deadened. For when we provide children
with too finished playthings we at the same
time deprive them of the incentive to perceive
the particular in the general, and of taking the
means to find it.… What presents are the
most prized by the child as well as by mankind
in general? Those which afford him a means of
unfolding his inner life most purely and of shaping
it in a varied manner, giving it freest activity and
presenting it clearly.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 122.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This quotation sets forth quite plainly the main
idea underlying all the varied toys or play-material
known as the “Gifts and Occupations” of the Kindergarten.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Hailmann and other writers, the
gifts are material by which the child can gain ideas,
and the occupations furnish material for gaining skill.
But Mr. Hailmann allows that this distinction, which
to him seems important, was never formulated by
Froebel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>Froebel’s psychological knowledge, in fact, was in
advance of that of his interpreters. He knew that it
was by action, by manipulation of material, that the
child gains his ideas and that the clear distinction
between gift and occupation which to Mr. Hailmann
is “very important” is on the contrary actually non-existent.</p>

<p>Gifts III to VI are boxes of building blocks, intended
to present sequence in difficulty of manipulation,
and also increasing variety of form. Because
of the stress he laid on self-expression, Froebel
thought very highly of the educational possibilities of
a box of bricks. In “The Education of Man” he
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Look into this education room of eight boys,
seven to ten years old. On the large table stands
a chest of building blocks, in the form of bricks,
each side about one-sixth of the size of actual
bricks, the finest and most variable material that
can be offered a boy for purposes of representation.
Sand or sawdust, too, have found their
way into the room, and fine green moss has been
brought in abundantly from the last walk in the
beautiful pine forest. It is free time, and each
one has begun his own work. There in a corner
stands a chapel … there a building which
represents a castle.…”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 108.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>After the bricks come the coloured tablets of Gift
VII, which children from four and upwards, <em>if left free</em>,
often highly appreciated as material for making patterns;
and the Sticks or splints of various lengths of Gift
VIII, with which they used to lay outlines of familiar
objects. English children often use burnt matches for
this, sometimes they do the same thing with “mother’s
pin-box,” and a child quite innocent of Kindergarten
ideas has been seen to appropriate the various nails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of a tool-box to the same purpose. Along with the
sticks Froebel supplied rings of metal or paper; the
little English child who used the nails took small
curtain rings for the petals of her flower and screw nails
for its stalk. In Gift IX the child is presented with
very small articles for stringing or arranging&mdash;beads,
coloured beans, pebbles, etc. A child’s pleasure in this
material and in the sticks and rings probably shows
that he is ready to practise movements of the thumbs
and forefingers. Froebel said that the use of these
sticks called the child’s attention to “linear phenomena,”
and I have already mentioned that many years
ago, when we were still using Froebel’s play-material,
I heard a child call out, “Oh, I’m making lines!”
just after he had been using the sticks. The other
children contentedly went on rubbing with the crayons;
but this young discoverer continued to make laborious
lines, always from left to right, till the work was
completed to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>The remaining “Gifts” include coloured paper to
fold and cut either to produce such objects as boats,
boxes, purses, chairs, etc., or to form patterns, or to
weave together for the well-known paper mat; drawing
and paper materials; modelling clay and sand,
and so on.</p>

<p>The weakness of the series is the semi-psychological
semi-mathematical arrangement, which has been dealt
with in the following chapter. What Froebel meant to
do was to pick out from among the material he saw
given to children, or appropriated by them, those
things which seemed to him best adapted to call out
the activities of children at various ages or stages, in
accordance with his idea that “the man advanced in
insight should make clear to himself the purpose of
playthings, viz. to help the child to express himself,
and to bring the phenomena of the outer world nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to him.”</p>

<p>Surprise has often been expressed that Froebel
did not include such toys as dolls in his series.</p>

<p>One reason is that he did not live long enough,
for he does speak of doll-play and says that later the
time will come “when we shall speak of the doll and
the hobby-horse as the plays of the awakening life of
the girl and of the boy.” In his brief reference he
does speak of the child’s own nature becoming objective
through the doll-play, and he adds that by such
play she “anticipates and feels her destiny.” He notes,
too, with interest that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Little girls make their favourite dolls of the
heavy bootjack or like piece of wood. I was
informed by a mother that a heavy sandbag
which she accidentally found became her most
cherished doll, because it had in it the weight of
an actual child, and so she gave herself up to the
illusion and imagined herself to be carrying a real
child.”</p>

</div>

<p>Undoubtedly Froebel was right in demanding
simple toys and in characterizing the “too complex
toy” as a “viper under the roses,” and also in demanding
that toys should be carefully considered and
chosen so as to meet the needs of the child’s
developing mind. But the plays and the toys of a
developing child cannot be definitely prescribed, and
every similar attempt is likely to fail, as Froebel’s
has done. In his choice, Froebel was biased by the
great idea which obsessed him, the idea of development.
Like all human beings, he had the defects of
his virtues, and it is to these defects that we must
now turn our attention.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smcap">Weak Points Considered</span></h2>

<p>An honest attempt to show what credit is due to
Froebel, for the remarkable anticipations of
modern theories on which he based his pedagogy,
seems to involve the opposite process of inquiring
whether or not any of his practices can be shown to
have an unsound basis.</p>

<p>The modern boys’ school, with a few, and a very
few exceptions, does not even approach the school at
Keilhau as a place of real education, as any one may
see who reads the account given of it by Georg Ebers.
On the other hand, the modern Kindergarten is probably
in many ways an advance upon the original
attempts. Many practices of which Froebel approved
are now discarded, some no doubt because of progress
in physiological discovery; we know now that a child
is not fitted as regards nervous development and
muscular control to deal with fine pricking or drawing
in chequers.</p>

<p>But a better knowledge of physiology does not
account for all the changes that have taken place.
Important as they undoubtedly were in Froebel’s eyes,
the modern Kindergartener is inclined to smile over
her predecessors’ “worship of the ‘Gifts’”; and,
though we are agreed as to the importance of games,
the modern teacher chooses from a wide, perhaps too
wide a range, and no longer reposes blind faith in certain
circle-games with their supposed “symbolic” virtue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>To some, the word symbolic will at once suggest
Froebel’s weakest point, others will resent any such
idea, for symbolism appeals strongly to one and repels
another. For Froebel himself, undoubtedly the whole
world was symbolic, in so far as he regarded the universe
as one expression of the Divine. To him, as to
Browning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The earth has speech of God’s writ down, no matter if</div>
<div class="verse">In cursive script or hieroglyph.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this has not affected his educational practice to
the extent generally supposed.</p>

<p>At the same time it does seem as if one, if not
two, psychological errors lie at the root of certain
practices which the modern Froebelian has discarded.</p>

<p>It would be most unfair to Froebel not to emphasize
what is often overlooked, viz. that the “Gifts” were
important in his eyes solely because he believed that
in them he was presenting toys, or “play-material,”
exactly suited to the succeeding stages of the child’s
development, bodily and mental. “The new gift,” he
says, “corresponds both to the child’s increasing constructive
ability, and to his growing capacity to comprehend
the external world.” And he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But such a course of training and occupations
for children answering to the laws of development
and the laws of life, demanded a thoroughly
expressive medium in the shape of materials for
these occupations and games for the child: therefore
to meet this point I have arranged a series
of play materials under the title of: ‘A complete
series of gifts for play.’”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 250.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It should also be noted that Froebel did not commit
the mistake of inventing new toys. What he
attempted to do was what we are all attempting now,
viz. to use what natural instinct has already selected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as a basis for conscious educational work. Balls and
building blocks, coloured tablets and papers, sand and
clay, are all spontaneously appropriated by normal
children. Even these materials which seem to us
unchildlike are not so in different surroundings. For
instance, in the Black Forest, one may watch children
playing with long slivers of wood exactly like Froebel’s
laths, and these they take from the cut logs which are
being hauled up for winter storage.</p>

<p>Again, it is only fair to point out that Froebel’s
followers have appropriated material which he suggested
as suited to children aged from three months
to five or six years, and have used them with children
from four or five to six or seven and even older.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Teachers have also found it convenient to disregard
Froebel’s frequent warnings not to interfere, to let
the child “bang and pound” when he wants to, to let
him “play quietly and thoughtfully by himself as long
as he will,” to give him “the greatest possible freedom
of expression.” In some, at least, of the original
text-books on Kindergarten practice, written by
Froebel’s early disciples, this advice is totally disregarded,
and we find prescribed the most formal of
object lessons, dealing with the properties of the ball
in set questions and answers; only at the end comes
“If there is time, the children may be allowed to roll
the ball.”</p>

<p>Still, when all due allowance is made, there remains
the fact that Froebel attributed far too much importance
to the series of toys he arranged, and in addition
to this he must be held in large measure responsible for
the extraordinary amount of mathematical perceptions
of which young children have been considered capable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and beneath which many gleams of intelligence may
have been extinguished.</p>

<p>The psychological error which seems to underlie
both these mistakes in pedagogy seems to have been
that of making too much of the outer factor in the
process of perception. Froebel was quite right and
quite modern in refusing to draw any hard and fast
line between sense perception and thinking, in saying
that the child moves “from perception of a thing,
joined with thought about it, up to pure thought.”
But he must have failed somehow, sufficiently to grasp
the fact that all that is present to sense is not necessarily
perceived, that perception depends not merely
upon what is presented, but upon previous mind content.
The word “apperception,” though apparently
somewhat fallen into disfavour of late, has certainly
been of service in emphasizing this point.</p>

<p>What seems strange is that in the very book, in
which we find the theory disregarded in practice, we
find Froebel stating the theory itself in the plainest of
terms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The properties and nature of the outer world
unfold themselves in exact proportion to the
capacities of the child.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 120.</cite></p>

<p>“The child creates his own world for himself;
it is at once the expression of his inward realization
of the external world and its surroundings,
and also the outward representation of his internal
mental world, the world of his own subjectivity.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 141.</cite></p>

<p>“Above all, it is the old within the new, which
clarifies, unfolds and transmutes itself, thus
developing what is new.… We must not require
of the child anything not conditioned by
his previous achievements.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 169.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>No one, surely, can maintain that these words are
carried into effect in e.g.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Could forms of knowledge (mathematical
forms) be, for a child of one to three, play forms,
and thus forms produced by spontaneous activity?
Well, why not? Arrange the eight part-cubes
together, and say, ‘One whole.’ But divide
it immediately and say, ‘Two halves.’… Or,
comparing and connecting and describing by song
at the same time that the objects are manipulated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Look here and see! One whole two halves.</div>
<div class="verse">One half two fourths, two halves four fourths.</div>
<div class="verse">One whole four fourths.</div>
<div class="verse">Four fourths eight eighths.</div>
<div class="verse">Eight eighths one whole.’”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 138.</cite></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is certainly no “old within the child” of one
to three, which can condition this achievement, nor
is there any spontaneity. For the child a little older
we have:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The hints that are here given suffice to show
that the knowledge forms are adapted to children
of three and four years of age, and that they incite
plays which are both spontaneous and nourishing
to heart and intellect.… These few indications
for the use of these forms must suffice; they
already show sufficiently clearly that the observation
and comprehension of them are perfectly
suited to the active, intellectual and emotional
sides of children three and four years of age, and
to actual free play which strengthens intellect and
feeling.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 185.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Now the “hints” refer to making clear to the child,
always in justice, be it remembered, in the concrete,
“as perceptible facts only,” such points as “similarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of size with dissimilarity of shape and position, in such
words as:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Twice as long and half as wide,</div>
<div class="verse">Half as long and twice as wide,</div>
<div class="verse">The same size are we two.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Certainly children differ very much, and some have
a special aptitude for mathematical relations, but to
most children under five these words would convey
nothing. <em>Half</em> may have a meaning, though at that
age and for some time after we hear of “a fair half”
and “quarter” is generally used as a name for any
fraction recognized as not a half, even if it should be
greater. Such words as <em>fourth</em> and <em>eighth</em> can have no
meaning for a child who shows no consciousness of
difference when shown six, seven or eight objects. At
the age of three, an average child recognizes three
objects, but when a fourth is added, he proceeds to
count one by one, he does not recognize three plus one.</p>

<p>Again, we must repeat that Froebel never intended
any mathematical ideas to be forced upon unwilling
children. He constantly tells the mother not to force,
and he frequently speaks of the child’s “accidental
productions which will become a point of departure
for his self-development,” through the explanatory
rhymes, to be sung by the mother in order to call the
child’s attention to the results of his own action. It
is true, too, that it is in connection with this kind of
work, or play, that Froebel writes of “the knowledge-acquiring
side of the game, which is the quickly
tiring side.”</p>

<p>But the fact remains that either Froebel made a
miscalculation as to what mathematical ideas are within
the grasp of children of tender age, or else he attributed
too much consequence to what is outside. It is indeed
quite possible to present to a child of any age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
by means of the cubes of his Fifth Gift, several particular
instances of the Theorem of Pythagoras, as
Froebel suggests. But though the construction is
present to the sense of both child and adult, the career
of the child of five or six, who perceives or apperceives
the relationship of the squares so presented, may be
watched with interest. He is likely to distinguish
himself in mathematical research, should he live long
enough. Froebel ought to have known, indeed he did
know, for he taught it to others, that the child does
not “quickly tire” of acquiring knowledge suited to
his stage of development by methods equally suitable.
From the houses and railway trains, of which at this
stage they seem never to tire, children probably gain
as much knowledge as Nature means them to absorb
by such means. In Froebel’s own hands, with his
real and sympathetic understanding of the need for
freedom of action, probably no harm was done, but it
is easy to see how the ordinary teacher would grasp
at the possibility of producing mathematical prodigies
through what was supposed to be play.</p>

<p>The same error seems to show itself in various
ways, e.g., in some of the reasons Froebel gives for
choosing his First Gift, though there is no fault to be
found with the choice. He was right in saying that
the child first takes in a whole, not a variety of
elements, to be combined later. Because of this fact,
the ordinary coral and bells, with all its complexity,
is just as much a whole to the infant as the woollen
ball. But Froebel does seem to have thought that he
must make the “outer objects,” or toys from which
the child is to gain his earliest ideas, as simple as these
ideas, and this certainly implies a wrong view of perception.
The same objection might be taken to
Froebel’s directions as to how the Third Gift&mdash;an
8-inch cube, cut once in each direction&mdash;is to be presented;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
how in order “to furnish to the child clearly
and definitely the impression of the whole, of the
self-contained, from which fundamental perception
everything must proceed,” the box is to be reversed,
the lid slipped out and the box is to be lifted “that
the play thing may appear as a cube closely united.”
But in this case Froebel is “presenting” the first divided
unit, “something which may be taken to pieces,
arranged and re-arranged and finally re-constructed,”
for it is “by this dismembering and re-constructing,
and perception of real objects that true knowledge and
especially self-knowledge comes to the child.”</p>

<p>A second psychological error, or at least an inconsistency,
seems to lie at the root of certain practical
directions Froebel gives with regard to the use of his
toys. In spite of his iteration and re-iteration that
the child’s mind is a unity, that though separation is
“permitted for the thinking mind,” there is none in
reality, yet in his anxiety for the due fostering of the
whole, of the “doing, feeling and thinking” his harmonious
development, in actual practice he has an
attempted separation which has had bad results. A
Kindergarten practice, now discontinued, was to make
the children build, either on different occasions, or
during different parts of one lesson, what Froebel
called (<i>a</i>) Life-forms or Objects (Lebens oder Sachformen),
i.e. houses, churches, etc.; (<i>b</i>) Beauty or
Picture forms (Schönheits oder Bildformen), i.e. symmetrical
designs; and (<i>c</i>) Knowledge or Instruction
forms (Erkenntniss oder Lernformen), i.e. squares,
triangles, etc. Though this classification is based on
the familiar and important “knowing, willing and
feeling,” yet it is plain that a child may experience
quite as much emotion, probably more, in building a
house as in making a star pattern, and that the active
side is involved in every kind of construction. Froebel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
draws a parallel, legitimate to a certain extent, between
intellect, feeling and will on the one hand, and truth,
beauty and usefulness on the other. Here, however,
we can quote him against himself; “Separation is
only permitted for the thinking mind.” The useful
ought to be beautiful, there is beauty in all truth,
and the æsthetic revelation of the world is the world
in order. Beauty degenerates into mere ornament
and artificiality, when separated from life and use.
“Mathematics,” as Froebel wrote himself, “is neither
foreign to life, nor deduced from life; it is the
expression of life as such: its nature may be studied
in life, and life may be studied with its help.…
Mathematics should be studied more physically and
dynamically as the outcome of nature and energy.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 206-7.</cite></p>

<p>The result of this suggested separation has in past
times been disastrous. Failing to recognize that a
young child is of necessity exercising his intellectual
power in constructing his castle or bridge of blocks,
and failing still more to realize that ornament is far
from synonymous with beauty, teachers have wearied
and stupefied children with mathematical forms for
which they were not ready, and have forced upon them
symmetrical designs when their souls hungered for
“puffer trains.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to show that what Froebel wanted was
only due attention to what we now call the affective
and conative as well as to the intellectual. From the
very first he insists on this, and justly, though his
way of doing it may seem to us quaint. About the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
child’s imitation of the clock he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As soon as the child’s first capacity for speech
is somewhat developed, we notice how he tries, in
and by the movement, to listen to the tone and
to imitate it with the tone of his own voice. <em>Tic
tac</em>, we hear him say, imitating the movement of
the pendulum; <em>pim paum</em> (ding dong?) he says
when the sound is more noticed.… So we must
observe that even when he first begins to speak
the child expresses and retains the physical part
of the movement by <em>tic tac</em>, but by <em>pim paum</em> he
perceives the movement more, if one may say so,
from the feeling in the mind, and if I may be
allowed so to express myself, by the ‘here and
there’ which comes later, the child catches hold
(festhalten) of the movement more as a thing of
comparison, of recognition, and in his dawning
thought, more intellectually.… It is most
important that the mother should observe the
first and slightest traces of the articulation
(Gliederung) of the child as an active, emotional
and intellectual being, and watch it in his development
from existence to experience and thought,
so that in his development no side of his nature
should be cultivated at the cost of the others, nor
should any be repressed or neglected for the sake
of the others. It seems important, and we believe
that all who quietly observe the child have remarked,
or will yet remark, that from the first
the child expresses the swinging movement in a
singing tone, in a tone which approaches song
and so serves the emotional nature. Thus early
is it shown that the real foundation, the starting-point
for the education of humanity and so of the
child, is the heart and the emotions (das Gemüth
u. die Gemüthliche), but that training to action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and thought (zur That u. zum Denken), the physical
and the intellectual goes with it side by
side constantly and inseparably. Thought forms
itself in action, and action clears itself in thought,
but both must have their roots in the emotions.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 41.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Two further reasons may be given for Froebel’s
belief in his selected series of toys: (<i>a</i>) his delight in
the theory of development, and (<i>b</i>) his eagerness to
bring the child as soon as possible to that consciousness
of self which differentiates man from the lower animals.</p>

<p>Every sign of unity of plan within the universe
gave Froebel real joy, and he traces development from
the simple to the complex, from the undifferentiated
to the differentiated, not only in plant and animal life,
but also in the inorganic. Much of what he says on
crystals may be fanciful, but much is beautiful and
suggestive. “Chemical combination” is to him “the
life of the inorganic world,” and he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have in this a new confirmation of the
law of development in crystals, the passing from
special-sidedness to all-sidedness, from imperfection
to perfection as the law of all development
in nature. Man, then, appears as the most
perfect earthly being, in whom all that is corporeal
appears in highest equilibrium and in whom the
primordial force is fully spiritualized, so that man
feels, understands, and knows his own power.
But while man externally and corporeally has
attained equilibrium and symmetry of form,
there heave and surge in him, viewed as a spiritual
being, appetites, desires and passions.</p>

<p>“As in the world of crystals we noticed the
heaving and surging of simple energy, and in the
vegetable and animal worlds, the heaving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
surging of living forces, so here the heaving and
surging of spiritual forces. Therefore man with
reference to spiritual development has returned to
a first stage as crystals are in a first stage with
reference to the development of life.… For
this reason the boy should at an early period be
taught to see Nature in all her diversity as a unit,
as a great living whole, as a thought of God. The
integrity of Nature, as a continually self-developing
whole must be shown him at an early period.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 198.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Although this particular passage was written in
connection with Nature Study for older boys, yet it
is from thoughts such as these that Froebel seems to
have taken an idea that man-in-infancy ought to meet,
if it may be so expressed, matter-in-infancy. Though
everything in the surroundings was to help to bring
about self-consciousness, “the air blowing about all
living creatures, as well as the arousing spiritual
language of words,” yet that definite thing-in-itself,
which is to help the child to an early dim consciousness
of self is to be “the counterpart of himself,” a simple
undifferentiated whole “susceptible of a progressive
development.”</p>

<p>And now we must come to the question of Froebel’s
“Symbolism,” a thorny subject, because one into
which the personal equation enters largely. Some
writers, notably Miss Susan Blow, author of “Symbolic
Education,” regard this symbolism as all-important,
Froebel’s glory rather than his weakness.
Others consider that it appeals to adults alone and
that where it is supposed to affect children it tends
towards artificiality and sentimentality. In so far as
this is true, it must be regarded as a weak point.</p>

<p>It is, however, not an easy task to settle what ideas
are covered by the term “Froebel’s symbolism.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
dictionary meaning for symbol is “a visible sign or
representation of an idea; anything which suggests
an idea, as by resemblance or convention; an emblem;
a representation; a type; a figure; as the lion is the
symbol of courage and the lamb of meekness or
patience.”</p>

<p>It certainly passes my comprehension how anything
can symbolize an idea not yet acquired, however
much it may help in calling up ideas already more or
less clearly gained. The crown may symbolize power
to an adult, but not to the child, who when told that
Stephen and Matilda fought for the crown, innocently
inquired: “Couldn’t they have had another one
made?” The Union Jack may symbolize British
nationality or British freedom, or even British Jingoism
to adults who already possess these ideas, but
not to a little child. On the other hand, any kind of
celebration appeals to children, as to more primitive
people, and to be allowed to march round the playground
on Empire Day carrying a flag arouses a joyous
emotion, which will later be interwoven with patriotic
ideas of various kinds. It is decidedly open to question
whether as regards the child Froebel himself
intended much more than this, whatever his followers
may have done.</p>

<p>Professor Thorndyke gives us to understand that
Froebel says a child plays with a ball because it symbolizes
“infinite development and absolute limitation.”
Now it is true that Froebel wrote in his “Aphorisms”&mdash;quoted
in a footnote to Hailmann’s “Education of
Man”&mdash;“The spherical is the symbol of diversity in
unity and of unity in diversity.… It is infinite
development and absolute limitation.” But the
“Aphorisms” were not written for children, and
Hailmann quotes the passage in speaking of Froebel’s
philosophical doctrines as to the ultimate nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
force and matter!</p>

<p>To Froebel, Spirit is everywhere striving for utterance.
The Universe&mdash;the Manifold&mdash;is the revelation
of one great mind, and everything in Nature, “though
soundless it be to the ear, a message can give emblematic
(sinnbildlich) but clear.” Certainly, he would
have the boy study Nature, “the writing and book of
God,” but it is not to the boy that he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The works speak, by the form the Spirit
manifests itself. By that which has been produced
and created, the nature and spirit of the
producer and creator make themselves known.
The world must therefore necessarily manifest the
nature of its original cause&mdash;the spirit of its
Creator.”</p>

</div>

<p>For Froebel as for Goethe, the Time Spirit “weaves
for God the garment we see Him by.” He calls “the
temporal an expression of the eternal, the material a
manifestation of the spiritual.” He speaks of “the
Power which reveals itself by uniting all things, in
Nature in the Universe as weight, in human life as
Love,” and it pleases him to put into the hand of the
boy&mdash;in that picture of a family group by which he
typifies Humanity&mdash;a ball hanging by a string, and
this he calls an emblem or symbol (Sinnbild).</p>

<p>There is nothing in all this with which any one
need quarrel. Froebel was assuredly an idealist, but
in these days that is no longer a term of reproach.
No one, to whom it does not appeal, need use the
suggestion, but to those of us who believe that right
guidance of a child’s delight in fairy tales is one way
of developing his sense of reverence, there is nothing
so very far fetched even in Froebel’s way of trying to
bring to the child’s consciousness, the spirit striving
for utterance not only in every beautiful form, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
everything beautiful as he does in “The Smell Song.”</p>

<p>Of fairy tales Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The child, like the man, would like to know
the meaning of what happens around him. This
is the foundation of the Greek choruses, especially
in tragedies. This, too, is the foundation of many
legends and fairy tales, and it is the result of the
deeply-rooted consciousness of being surrounded
by that which is higher and more conscious than
ourselves.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 147.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>So, when the child delights in the scent of the
flower, Froebel says to the mother: “Let your child
find in all things a mind, a struggle for being. Colour
form and spicy smell all forthtell the One ruling hand
which called all into existence.” But all she is told
to pass on to the child is only the thought that an angel
has put the scent there and is saying: “The little one
does not see me, but without me there would be no
fragrance.”</p>

<p>Although in one sense the educator of young children
need have no dealings at all with “symbolism,”
yet in another, a walking-stick does, for the boy who
bestrides it, symbolize, a horse, as a piece of wood may
symbolize for his little sister the infant whom she may
nurse and caress, with what Froebel calls “the dim
and transferred perception of inner life.” Here
Froebel seems quite right, as when in speaking of a
child’s visit to a toyshop he says, “a true child is
content with very little of the outer, he is satisfied by
a doll or cart, a whistle or a sheep, provided only that
in or through it he can find his own world and represent
it in actual deeds.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 199.</cite></p>

<p>It may be said, too, that there is symbolism in
children’s drawings, the animal or object is symbolized
by that which to the child is the most outstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
characteristic. One small boy drew a camel with a
rider so small that some one protested he could not
see over the hump, so the artist promptly drew a
second rider in front. Being asked if he could draw
an elephant, he assented cheerfully and added a trunk
to his camel. By the addition of claws the elephant
became a cat, but at that point he paused, remarking,
“It’s not very like a cat, it’s more like a bird,” and a
pair of wings completed the transformations. In like
manner by help of a walking stick a child becomes his
own father, and a pair of spectacles transforms him
into his grandmother. But in all such cases the child
is dealing with ideas he has already grasped.</p>

<p>To say that circle or ring games help a child to
gain an idea of unity&mdash;Ring a Ring of Roses may give
the first dim idea of corporate unity&mdash;is a very different
thing from saying that a circle is to the child a
symbol of unity. This is the kind of thing, however,
that Froebel is supposed to have said, but after careful
investigation one is surprised to find how little there
is, and to what extent Froebel’s disciples and
translators seem to have read in their own interpretations.</p>

<p>For instance, in searching for passages about symbolism,
we find in the English translation of the paper
on Movement Plays, a passage stating that the “Snail
Game” forms a frequent conclusion to a “games”
period, because it yields the form of the circle, “which
is symbolic of wholeness.” On comparing this with
the original, however, we find that this phrase is an
addition of the translator’s. No doubt she considered
it explanatory, but all that Froebel himself says is that
the game is suitable “because it finally unites all the
players in a lively and completely finished whole.” To
practical teachers, who know the difficulty of getting
a number of children to settle down after a game, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
may bear a very different meaning.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Froebel’s translators have
been altogether too fond of the word “symbolic.”
The German words usually translated “symbol” and
“symbolic” are “Sinnbild” and “Vorbild,” with their
respective adjectives. After considering innumerable
passages in which these words occur it seems plain
that Froebel’s meaning would often have been better
expressed by “typical,” or by “significant,” and
sometimes by “metaphorical.”</p>

<p>For instance, it is quite legitimate to say of such
perceptions as Froebel intended a child to gain from
his second “Gift”&mdash;resistance, weight, hardness and
softness, noise, etc.&mdash;that the ball and cube give, and are
only intended to give, “normal, fundamental and <em>typical</em>
perceptions” (nur die normalen, begründenden und
vorbildlichen Anschauungen), and Froebel goes on to
say that the same perceptions must come from many
other objects. There is nothing <em>symbolic</em> here, and
there is no reason for using this word.</p>

<p>That in many passages <em>significant</em> would be a much
more correct translation than symbolic is abundantly
evident. Froebel was convinced, and most people will
now agree with him, that there is real meaning or
significance in those activities, which are common to
children of all countries, and this meaning he endeavours
to discover. Small blame to him if, though
wonderfully correct on the whole, he sometimes hits
upon a wrong meaning, in which case we are apt to fall
back upon that convenient scapegoat, his symbolism.</p>

<p>In one of his letters he thanks his cousin for
describing to him how she had watched a tiny child
“who quietly let his eye travel from the ball hanging
at the end of its cord, up to the hand which held it,”
and he adds:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am convinced, and I wish that all teachers,
and especially all mothers, shared in the conviction,
that the very earliest phenomena of child-life
are <em>full of symbolic meaning</em>, that is to say,
they indicate the higher, the intellectual life in the
child and his individual peculiarities at the same
time. Our duty is to search in everything for its
ultimate basis, its point of origin, its well-spring;
and to make clear the connection between the
outward manifestation and its inward cause.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 101.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>What Froebel deduced from the incident was
that the child looks not only at the appearance of
the swinging ball, but for the cause of the swinging
phenomenon, the supporting, moving hand. So it is
plain that for “full of symbolism” we should here
read “full of significance.” Or, again, in his excellent
sketch of early boyhood, with its desire to share the
work of the father, its desire to explore, to collect, to
construct, etc., Froebel concludes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thus it is certain that very many of the
boy’s actions have an inner, an intellectual importance,
that they indicate his mental tendencies
and are therefore <em>symbolical</em>.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 118.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Here, again, <em>significant</em> would be a better English
translation than <em>symbolical</em>.</p>

<p>Again, in accordance with his belief in instinct,
Froebel declares that it is his “firm conviction that
wherever we find anything that gives children ever
freshly a joy belonging to real life there is at the bottom
of it something important for a child’s life.” When
he sees that children often enjoy going to church and
joining in the singing at an age when the words can
have no meaning, he says: “All the spontaneous
activity of child-life is <em>symbolical</em> (Sinnbildlich).” But
there is not a word of anything that is ordinarily called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
“symbolical” in what follows, so far as the child is
concerned. The little one is supposed to have
“reached a new life-stage,” viz. “the dim anticipation
that he is not alone in life, but one amid mankind.”
Consequently he is attracted by “assembly life.” The
most ardent believer in symbolism can make little of
the very practical answers the mother is told to give
to the child’s questions. He is to be answered “out
of the range of his own experience, feelings and ideas,
his own intellectual development and necessities.”
He is to be told that when he is old enough to go to
church, he will not only like to hear the organ, but
will find out “why flowers bloom and birdies sing and
why we still remember Christmas Day.”</p>

<p>There is another child in the Mother Songs, who
wants to visit the moon, and drags his mother towards
the ladder that he may climb up. According to the
translator Froebel says he wants to point out “the
higher symbolical meaning.” But what he says is
that one remark presses itself upon him, how “we
ought to cultivate intelligently the child’s observation
of and pleasure in the moon, and in the night sky, and
not let this sink into the formlessness and emptiness
of mere wonder.” For example, it is, he says, quite
as easy to tell a child that the moon is a beautiful
bright swimming ball, as to say it is a man; or that
the stars are sparkling suns which look small because
they are far away, as to call them “golden pins,” and
he adds “Truth never injures, but error always does.”</p>

<p>There are certainly some instances in which Froebel
found for the tendencies and actions of children, a
meaning that does not commend itself to common
sense, but as a rule he only “ventures to suggest”
rather than insists, and his practical application is
generally unobjectionable. We assent willingly, when
Froebel tells us that rhythmic movement, passive as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
well as active, is the earliest beginning of all ordered
activity. But we smile when, in accounting for the
childish interest in clocks, after allowing for the
mystery, he goes on:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let me hold the opinion that a deeply slumbering
notion of the importance of time lies at the
bottom of the pleasure children take in playing
with a clock.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 139.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>As he truly and naïvely remarks, “this opinion of
mine hurts, as an opinion, neither the child nor any
one else,” and the application may, even in this instance,
be useful as he says it is, viz. that we should
use this pleasure to instil the beginnings of punctuality
or law and order. As an opinion it is not worthy of
Froebel’s insight, and we can only say that instances
of this kind are really negligible, though some have
been unnecessarily emphasized by certain Froebelians
to whom they appeal.</p>

<p>There are, it is true, a few instances which deserve
the strictures which have been heaped up somewhat
rashly. It is only put as a question, but Froebel does
say of children’s pleasure in circle games, “May not
their delight spring from the longing and efforts to get
an all-round, or all-sided, grasp of an object?”</p>

<p>As to metaphor, Froebel delights in this; his bent
of mind is to take pleasure in all analogies, and he
suggests that the mother should make more use of the
metaphors implied in ordinary language. For example,
he speaks of “the transferred moral meaning of such
words and phrases as ‘<em>straight</em> and <em>straightforward</em>,’
and of ‘<em>walking in crooked paths</em>.’” In using little
finger plays to give a child control over his hands, the
mother is told to think how important for later life
is “the right handling of things, in the actual as well
as in the figurative sense.” The wise mother is represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
as cherishing the child’s love of light and brightness,
saying, “Never shrink away from light”; and
while she shows the picture she says, “Here is a boy
who has broken the window and now he must go a
long way to fetch the glazier unless he can content
himself with a dark board that will keep out the dear
bright light. You must not heedlessly stop Light’s
entering your heart and mind, for if you do, you will
have to buy it back by trouble and loss of time lest
heart and mind become dark. Open your door and
little window to the light.” Thus she makes the child
“see inner things through the outer,” and uses his
pleasure in light to make him hate deeds of darkness.
But there is no harm in all this, the words are used as
a clergyman uses the half-dozen words of his text,
as a germ of thought which he cultivates, as a finger-post
pointing the way in which our minds may travel.
And Froebel, like the clergyman, sometimes travels
far from the branching of the roads.</p>

<p>Froebel’s curious attempts at etymology ought
perhaps to be mentioned as a weak point, though
they really do not affect his theories, psychological or
educational, one way or another. The ball, as the
child’s first object through which he gains his first
perceptions of solidity, weight, mass, etc., is described
as on that account “an image of the universe” (der
B&mdash;all ist der Bild des Alles). The thought is worth
having, the pseudo-etymology does not much matter.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, there is mysticism in Froebel’s
writings as addressed to the adult, and with this no
one has any right to quarrel even if it should not appeal
to him or her personally. But an undue preponderance
has been given to this side of Froebel by those to
whom it appeals, or so it seems to me. It does not
appeal to me, nor can I perceive that it affects to any
appreciable extent the educational theories based on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the psychological grounds so carefully considered by
Froebel. To writers like Miss Blow, the author of
“Symbolic Education,” such a statement would no
doubt seem outrageous. With intellectual people possessed
of Miss Blow’s philosophic insight, children
may be safe from artificiality and sentimentality.
But the average teacher is incapable of philosophy,
and when the uncultured mind is supplied with food
it cannot digest, that mind is starved. The teacher
who glibly uses phrases which she does not understand
has reached a state of mind immeasurably below plain
ignorance, for it is destructive of honest thought and
common sense.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The main business of the Froebelian
is to forward the cause to which Froebel devoted his
life “to bring about a more general use of progressive
development in the culture and education of children.
We must throw overboard everything that hampers
action and set before ourselves, as in his day Froebel
tells us he attempted to do, the definite task of “founding
anew the practical methods of actual teaching so
as to bring them into satisfactory relation with the
needs of our life of to-day.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smcap">Some Criticisms Answered</span></h2>

<p>Professor Adams ends the first chapter of his
delightfully witty “Herbartian Psychology” with
a challenge to all educational thinkers to come
out of their caves and defend their idols. Throughout
the book, there is many a side-thrust at Froebel, all
of a more or less disparaging nature, in spite of the
humorous twinkle which has a fairly permanent abode
in the eye of the writer.</p>

<p>Some of the accusations are tolerably sweeping,
for example, that Froebelianism “as a psychology is
simply non-existent”; that Froebel has failed to
correlate theory and practice; that although in “The
Education of Man” “we have beautiful, if obscurely
expressed, truths about education,” yet the Kindergarten
cannot be evolved from it, in fact “between
the two there is a great gulf fixed, a gulf that Froebel
has not bridged.”</p>

<p>But the main contention is that Froebel disapproves
in theory of any interference with the natural
course of development. The Froebelian teacher is
thus, according to Professor Adams, reduced to the
position of a “humble under-gardener” who merely
watches with interest and admiration, and education
becomes “a general paralysis.”</p>

<p>Mr. Graham Wallas, whose objections to Froebel,
or at least to Froebelianism<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, as he understands it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
are well known, bases these on the ground that because
he was a pre-Darwinian evolutionist, Froebel was
bound to overrate the importance of the innate as a
factor in development, and to undervalue the other
factor of environment.</p>

<p>Professor O’Shea disposes of Froebel in one sentence
and in much the same way, as an advocate of what
he calls “the doctrine of Unfoldment,” where “everything
is inner and self-relating,” as opposed to the
conception gained from Biology, which “implies that
the business of a human being is to get properly
related to the world&mdash;religious, social and physical&mdash;of
which he is an integral part.”</p>

<p>If Froebel really believed that development is
entirely from within, as stated by Professor O’Shea,
or if he failed to realize the importance of the surroundings,
as Mr. Graham Wallas expresses it, he
would naturally disapprove of any interference, as
Professor Adams says he does. The Froebelian, being
thus reduced to passive watching, the mere provision
of a Kindergarten would be an interference with the
surroundings and a contradiction in practice of the
theory of non-interference. If non-interference is
really the theory propounded in “The Education of
Man,” there certainly is a gulf between it and the
Kindergarten, a gulf it would be difficult to bridge.</p>

<p>But Froebelians are not prepared to admit the
premises of any of these critics. It seems to many of
us that these and all similar criticisms are due to misunderstanding.
This is sometimes clearly due to
careless reading, and consequent want of attention
to the context, but even where this is not the case,
misunderstandings occur. Few, of late years, have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
any real study of Froebel’s writings as a whole, such
as is necessary to get at his real meaning, which is often
obscured by prolixities and repetitions, and sometimes
hidden among apparent trivialities.</p>

<p>Professor O’Shea, for example, does not seem to be
aware to what extent Froebel, like himself, derived
his educational aim and principles from biology. He
has probably never realized the deep interest taken
by Froebel in the then all-absorbing question of natural
development. Clearly he has no idea that Froebel has
given expression to a conception of education, practically
identical with that given above which he himself
draws from biology,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and sets in contrast with the
one he unjustly attributes to Froebel.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that Froebel laid much
stress on what is innate. In his generation, he tells
us the child was looked upon “as a piece of wax, or
lump of clay, which man can mould into what he
pleases.” Because Froebel was a student of biology
he knew better. He knew, as we have seen, that
human beings have instincts, innate tendencies or
dispositions differing from those of the lower animals
chiefly in their indefiniteness. We are not so afraid
of the word “innate” nowadays, when both innate
ideas and innate faculties are safely buried, and that
Froebel had no dealings with these has been amply shown.</p>

<p>But that this stress on innate tendencies implies
that the child is to unfold from within, the educator
standing by passive<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, or that Froebel imagined that
the developing process could go on with little or no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
reference to the environment, is quite another matter.</p>

<p>Few of Froebel’s critics have taken the trouble to
look up the original German before pronouncing condemnation,
and this explains part of the injustice that
has been done to him. The passage upon which much,
perhaps most, of the adverse criticism is based is the
one in which Froebel applies to education the term
“leidend,” translated “passive” in both the English,
or, rather, American editions of “The Education of
Man.” The translation of “leidend” as “passive”
is not a happy one. Moreover, the translators have
endeavoured to help the reader by dividing the text
into numbered sections, a proceeding which though
often helpful, sometimes tends to break the continuity
of Froebel’s thought. This effect is heightened in
Hailmann’s translation by the interpolated notes,
however valuable as some of these are in themselves.
This passage, however, opens with “<em>therefore</em>,” and
those who take exception to it ought to have considered
the preceding argument. Fair criticism looks
back to see why and under what circumstances education
is to be “passive or following,” as opposed to
“dictating and limiting.”</p>

<p>In the first place, absolutely passive education is a
contradiction in terms. Froebel begins by stating that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Education consists in leading man as a
thinking, intelligent being, growing into self-consciousness,
to a pure, conscious and free representation
of the law of his being, and in teaching
him ways and means thereto.”</p>

</div>

<p>He defines the <em>Theory of Education</em> as “the system
of directions derived from the knowledge and study of
that law to guide human beings in the apprehension
of their life-work”; and the <em>Practice of Education</em> as
“the self-active application of this knowledge in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
direct development and cultivation of rational beings
towards the attainment of their destiny.”</p>

<p>To go on from this to say, on the next page but
one, that the educator is to do nothing, to stand aside
and be truly passive, would be absurd.</p>

<p>That our word “passive” is not the equivalent of
Froebel’s word “leidend,” is easily proved, for in
another passage where Froebel does mean “passive”
he couples “leidend” with “inactive,” and puts
passive in a bracket beside it. The passage runs:
“wo das Kind äusserlich als unthätig, leidend (passiv)
erscheint.” In the passage under discussion “passiv”
does not appear at all, and “leidend” is coupled, not
with “inactive,” but with “following,” and is contrasted
with “dictating, limiting and interfering.”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>A few lines further we read how the gardener may
even destroy the vine “if he fail <em>in his work</em> passively
and attentively to follow the nature of the plant.”
He cannot surely “work” and be inactively passive
at the same time.</p>

<p>A more correct translation of “leidend” here
would perhaps be “tolerant” or “suffering” in its
old sense of “permitting,” “bearing with,” or having
patience with.</p>

<p>As to immediate context, Froebel has just stated
that education ought “to lift man to a knowledge of
himself and mankind, to a knowledge of God and
Nature, and to the pure and consecrated life conditioned
thereby.” “But,” he goes on, “education
must be founded on what is essential or innermost,
and though the real nature of things can only be known
by outer manifestations, yet it behoves the educator
to be very careful how he judges, for the child that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
appears good outwardly, is often not really good, i.e.
does not will the good from his own determination,
or from love, respect for or recognition of it,” while
“the outwardly rough self-willed child often has
within him a vigorous struggle to do what seems to
him right.” Judging from outer manifestations furnishes
constant occasion for false judgments concerning
the motives of children, for endless misunderstanding
between parent and child, and for unreasonable demands
made upon children.</p>

<p>And here comes the force of the conjunction:
“<em>Therefore</em>,” says Froebel, “education, instruction
and training in their fundamental principles must
necessarily be tolerant, following, not dictating, not
limiting or defining, not interfering.”</p>

<p>What is it, then, that Froebel is telling us to follow
almost passively, interfering, in our ignorance, as little
as possible? Simply the natural order of development,
the natural instincts of childhood, which in this very
passage he is arguing are as trustworthy as those of
other young animals. Here, as everywhere, man can
only control Nature <em>by following</em>, by obeying her
laws.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the duckling hastens to the pond and the
chicken scratches the ground, so will the human
being, still young, still, as it were, in the process
of creation, though as unconsciously as any Nature
product, yet definitely and surely desire what is
best for him. We give plants and animals time
and space and freedom to develop, but the young
human being is to man a piece of wax, a lump of
clay, from which he can mould what he will. O
man, who roamest through garden and field,
through meadow and grove, why dost thou close
thy mind to the silent teaching of Nature?”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 8.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>Surely we have here a plea to “suffer (leiden)
little children,” to bear with the little one, still, as
Froebel describes him, “still, as it were, in the process
of creation,” nay, more, a plea for the actual recognition
and fostering of these instinctive tendencies
which Professor Dewey calls “the foundation-stones of
educational method,” rather than a recommendation to
“gratify every youthful impulse,” or to stand aside altogether.
For the context, the whole, is not yet complete.</p>

<p>Froebel goes on to say that if we are certain of any
tendency to unhealthy development we are to interfere
with full severity (so tritt geradezubestimmende,
fordernde Erziehungsweise in ihrer ganzen Strenge ein).</p>

<p>And now comes a sentence apparently quite overlooked
by Mr. Graham Wallas, who blames Froebel
for underestimating the environment. In the mean-time,
until we are sure that our interference is justifiable,
“nothing is left for us to do but to bring the
child into relations and surroundings in all respects
adapted to him.”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;<cite>E., p. 11.</cite></p>

<p>In many other passages Froebel shows plainly that
he had no thought of the “gratifying of every youthful
impulse” in the sense of individual caprice.</p>

<p>In his plea for monetary help to establish Kindergartens
and training establishments connected with
them, he complains that in existing institutions children
are either “repressed and their energies crippled,
<em>or else we are confronted with the wild and uncontrollable
character which results when children are uncared
for and are left altogether to their own impulses</em>.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 159.</cite></p>

<p>“Life has no room for wilfulness and whims,” he
says in his Mother Songs; “Boyhood is the age of
Discipline” he states in “The Education of Man.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
But, as he himself sums up this discussion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All true education is double-sided, prescribing
and following, active and passive, positive yet
giving scope, firm and yielding.… Between
educator and pupil should rule invisibly a third
something to which both are equally subject.
The third something is the right, the best …
the child, the pupil has a very keen apprehension
whether what father or teacher requests is personal
and arbitrary or the expression of general law
and necessity.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 14.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>The proof of whether or not the educator has succeeded
in rightly adjusting the claims of freedom and
authority, Froebel expresses in words recalling Kant’s,
“When the ‘Thou Shalt’ of the Law becomes the
‘I will’ of the doer, then we are free.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In good education, in genuine instruction, in
true teaching, necessity must and will call forth
freedom, law will call forth self-determination, and
outer compulsion inner free-will.</p>

<p>“Where necessity produces bondage, where law
brings fraud and crime, and outer compulsion
causes slavery, there every effect of education is
destroyed. There oppression destroys and debases,
severity and harshness bring obstinacy and deceit,
and the burden is more than can be borne.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 14.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>To emphasize the fact that Froebel did realize the
importance of environment, and to anticipate the
criticism that this shortened rendering is an interpretation
in the light of modern educational theories, of
Froebel’s somewhat cumbrous phrases, we can turn to
a passage in his later writing, part of which has been
quoted elsewhere:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Through the child’s efforts to repel that
which is contrary to the needs of his life, indignation
and discontent are awakened; and on the
other hand, from the fact that his normal desires
are ungratified, they become inordinate and mischievous.
How may parents avoid these evil
results? Most satisfactorily through a threefold
yet single glance at life. Let them look into
themselves, and their own course of development
and its requirements, let them recall their own
earliest years, then later stages of development,
and look deeply into their present life. Next,
let them look equally deeply into the life of the
child and what he must require for his present
stage of development. Having scrutinized what
the child needs, <em>let them scrutinize his environment</em>,
and first observe what it offers and does not offer
for the fulfilment of such requirements. Let them
utilize all offered possibilities of meeting normal
needs; and when such needs cannot be met, let
them recognize this fact, and show the child
plainly the impossibility of their fulfilment. Finally,
let them clearly recognize whatever <em>in the
child’s environment</em> tends to awaken antagonism
and discontent, remove it if it be removable, and
admit its defect if it be not removable.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;<cite>P., p. 167.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>It is, of course, true that Froebel was pre-Darwinian
in time, but it is equally true that he was post-Darwinian
in many of his beliefs.</p>

<p>To find out whether or not his educational doctrines
are really based on false or exploded theories of
development, as the Criticism of Mr. Graham Wallas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
implies, we must gather together from Froebel’s various
writings, his most important references to the subject.</p>

<p>The key-note to his interest in it lies probably in
the yearning for unity and union in all relations, which
was a part of his individuality. This may have dated
back to the time when, a puzzled little mortal of eight
or nine years old, he was most unwisely allowed to
hear his father exhorting and rebuking his parishioners.
It seemed to the boy that most of the trouble arose
from the fact that human beings, and human beings
alone, so far as he knew, were divided into two sexes,
and he felt that he would have arranged matters
differently. Comfort came to him when his older
brother, by showing him the male and female flower
of the hazel, gave him some idea of a great law of
Nature. Strange comfort, too, it seems, for a boy not
yet ten years old!</p>

<p>The late Mr. Ebenezer Cooke pointed out long ago<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
that Mr. Graham Wallas had not only overshot the mark
in saying that “Darwin transferred the cause of development
from within to without,” but that he had himself
failed to draw any distinction between the facts of
development, as seen in the individual, and the theory
of the origin or development of species, which we
associate with the names of Darwin and Wallace.
Mr. Cooke pointed to Froebel’s connection with Batch,
the founder of a Natural History Society, of which
Goethe was a member, as showing that he was in
direct touch with those who were working out the
theory of development of the individual.</p>

<p>Froebel himself refers to this Natural History
Society in his Autobiography, saying that “students,”
of whom he was one, “who had shown living interest
and done active work in Natural Science,” were invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
to become members, and that this awoke within him
“a yearning towards higher scientific knowledge.” At
this time Froebel was but a youth of seventeen, with
no idea that education was to be his life work. Three
years later, he meets a private tutor, “a young man
quite out of the common, with actively inquiring
mind,” who was “especially fond of making comprehensive
schemes of education.” The year after this
we find him reading what he can of anthropology and
history, and saying of his reading: “It taught me of
man in his broad historical relations and set before
me the general life of my kind as one great whole.”</p>

<p>One year more, and while he is looking for a situation
with an architect&mdash;in spite of uneasy communing
with himself as to how architecture was to be used
“for the culture and ennoblement of mankind”&mdash;Grüner
claps him on the shoulder with “Give up
architecture, it is not your vocation at all! Become
a teacher.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps because Froebel passed thus from
interest in biology to interest in education that at
this time he gives to his own question, What is the
purpose of education?&mdash;almost the identical answer
that Professor O’Shea puts into the mouth of his biologist<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>,
and which he sets in opposition to Froebel’s
supposed opinions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In answering the question, What is the purpose
of education? I relied at that time on the
following observations: Man lives in a world of
objects, which influence him and which he desires
to influence; therefore he ought to know these
objects in their nature, in their conditions and
in their relations with each other and with mankind.…
I sought, to the extent of such
powers as I consciously possessed at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to make clear to myself the meaning of all things
through man, his relations with himself, and with
the external world … it seemed to me that
everything which should or could be required for
human education must be necessarily conditioned
and given, by virtue of the very nature of the
necessary course of his development, in man’s
own being and in the relations amidst which he
is set. A man, it seemed to me, would be well
educated when he had been trained to care for
these relationships and to acknowledge them, to
master them and to survey them.”&mdash;<cite>A., p. 69.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>In the very beginning, then, of his educational
career, Froebel emphasized rather than overlooked
“the relationships amidst which man is set,” but he
was to learn more yet about development.</p>

<p>Six years later he is back at a university, and
“just at this time,” he says, “those great discoveries
of the French and English philosophers became generally
known through which the great manifold external
world was seen to form a comprehensive outer world.”</p>

<p>The English writer may have been Erasmus Darwin.
The French writer was no doubt Lamarck, to whom
belongs “the immortal glory of having for the first
time worked out the theory of Descent as an independent
scientific theory of the first order and as the
philosophical foundation of the whole science of
Biology.”</p>

<p>From some such source, at any rate, Froebel must
have gained “the key-note of development,” viz., that
it is always from the undifferentiated to the differentiated.
We have already seen that he applied this to
mental development and so gained his modern conception
of the earliest infant consciousness, “an
undifferentiated unorganized unity.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>In “The Education of Man” he speaks of</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“the all-pervading law of Nature according to
which the general gives rise to the particular,”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 167.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>and in the Mother Songs he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whether we are looking at a seed or an egg,
whether we are watching feeling or thought, what
is definite proceeds everywhere from what is
indefinite.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 121.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Or, again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the child as in the grain of seed, there
begins a development proceeding towards complexity.”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 172.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Such quotations fully exonerate Froebel from belief
in any “pre-formation” theory, whether physical or
mental, as indeed Mr. Cooke made abundantly plain.</p>

<p>It is in one of his later papers<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that Froebel generalizes
and states very plainly how everything is developed
under the influence of its environment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Taking Nature as our guide, let us endeavour
to find the essential nature of material objects
and the conditions under which this develops, for
the process of development shows the essence of
the developing object.</p>

<p>“<em>Firstly</em>, each thing and each object manifesting
existence and life, develops itself in accordance
with the highest and simplest, the general
laws of life. Thus everything manifests these laws
and their primeval cause.</p>

<p>“<em>Secondly</em>, each thing and each object in
Nature develops itself according to its own individuality
and the laws of its being.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<p>“<em>Thirdly</em>, everything in Nature develops itself
under the collective influence of all things. If any
object seems to be withdrawn from this collective
influence, such withdrawal is only mediate.…</p>

<p>“In Nature, and in everything, all things
develop as members of the world-whole, the
universal life, as members of a whole, each perfect
in its kind, because each, while standing in the
centre of the collective influence streaming upwards
and inwards&mdash;nay, in a certain sense, as the receiver,
yielding itself to this influence&mdash;yet also acts (as
assimilative and formative) and develops itself,
faithful to the indwelling laws of life universal
and particular. We must see clearly the conditions
of perfect development in Nature, and
then employ them in human life. Thus only can
we help man to attain, upon the plane of human
development&mdash;which means spiritual development&mdash;a
degree of perfection corresponding to that
which the forms and types of Nature show upon
the plane of physical development.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 196.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>When child development is in question, far from
minimising, as he is supposed to do, the importance of
environment, parents and teachers are told:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We must hold fast for consideration in life
this fact, that in the spontaneous occupation and
playing of the child, not the germ only, but the
growing point of his life also, is formed <em>in union
with his surroundings, and under their silent unremarked
influence</em> (im Vereine mit der Umgebung
und unter deren stillen unbemerkten Einwirkung).”&mdash;<cite>P.,
p. 108.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Or, again:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As the new-born child, like a ripe grain of
seed dropped from the mother plant has life in
itself, and as it spontaneously develops life <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><em>in
progressive connection with the common life whole</em>;
so activity and action are the first phenomena of
his awakening life. This activity bears the impress
of what is innermost, it is an inner activity whose
purpose is manifestation of the inner through the
outer, and, as leading up to this, devoted to consideration
of and working with the outer to penetrating
the outer and overcoming hindrances as
such.”&mdash;<cite>P., p. 23.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>This account surely makes plain, that whatever
Froebel may have believed with regard to the origin
of species, he in no way believed that development in
general was a one-sided process, in which the environment
went for nothing.</p>

<p>In his “Criticism,” Mr. Graham Wallas remarked:
“Whoever divorced his educational system from his
philosophy, would have seemed to Froebel to have
taken all force and meaning out of his work.” This
is most true, and it approaches absurdity to attribute
so limited a view to a man imbued as Froebel was with
the philosophical doctrine of the reconciliation of the
opposites.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> That all development was the result of a
harmony between opposites was one of his cardinal
doctrines.</p>

<p>“We are living in an age,” he writes, “when we
are consciously under a law of development acting by
the reconciliation of opposites.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hailmann gives a long footnote where Froebel
is quoted as comparing his idea of the law of connection
or unification with the ideas of Fichte and Hegel,
and saying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is both of these, and yet has nothing in
common with either of them; it is the law which
the contemplation of Nature has taught me.…
And where do we find absolute contrasts that have
not somewhere and somehow a connection? In
action and reaction the contrasts that we see
everywhere give rise to the motions in the universe
as they do in the smallest organism. This implies
for all development a struggle which however
sooner or later will find its adjustment; and this
adjustment is the connection of contrasts.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 42.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>What Froebel knew of Hegel’s philosophy was
probably gained from discussions among his friends,
for in the hearing of Madame von Marenholz, he said,
“I do not know how Hegel formulates and applies
this law, for I have had no time for the study of his
system,” and he went on to say of “the philosophical
systems of others” that “most of them belong to a
theory of the world that is passing away, whose one-sidedness
becomes more apparent every day”
(Reminiscences, 225). Ebers, too, speaks of Froebel’s
ideas as opposed to those of Hegel.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Graham Wallas allows that Froebel’s
casual references to the development of species are
“surprisingly modern.” No orthodox views as to the
exact date of the creation of the world keep him from
accepting the newly discovered testimony of the rocks
as to “the remains of perished ages.” Ardent as his
religious convictions were, they had a philosophic
width unusual indeed in his day. The Garden of
Eden is to him a parable, repeated “in the experience
of every child from the time of his appearance on
earth to the time when he consciously (by the help of
names) beholds himself in beautiful Nature spread out
before him.” In each child he sees “repeated at a
later period, the deed which marks the beginning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
moral and human emancipation, of the dawn of reason.”</p>

<p>He refers calmly to</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“the fall, or, since the result is the same, the
ascent of the mind of man, from simple, uniform,
emotional development, into the development of
externally analytic and critical reason.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 194.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Not Stanley Hall himself insists more that the
development of the individual shall follow the development
of the race, and this in 1826, two years before
Baer, and four years before Comte, to whom Herbert
Spencer attributed the doctrine. “Humanity,” he says,
“lives only in its continuous development.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Each successive generation and each successive
individual human being, inasmuch as he
would understand the past and present, must pass
through all preceding phases of human development
and culture, and this should not be done in
the way of dead imitation or mere copying, but
in the way of living spontaneous self-activity.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 18.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>There is certainly no ground for assuming that
Froebel held any such pre-Darwinian views as a special
creation of each species, for there is no point on which
he insists more emphatically than that in Nature
development is continuously progressive.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In God’s world, just because it is God’s
world, by Him created, one thing constant is
expressed to which we give the name of unbroken
progression of development in all and through
all.”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>&mdash;<cite>M., p. 154.</cite></p>

<p>“God neither ingrafts nor inoculates, He develops
the most trivial and imperfect things in continuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
ascending series and in accordance with
eternal self-grounded and self-developing laws.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 328.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Winch makes merry over Froebel’s sentence:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As Man and Nature have one origin, they
must be subject to the same laws,”</p>

</div>

<p>and remarks that “this conception is almost completely
given up.… Our view now rather is one
in which God and Nature are at strife, in which the
ethical interest overcomes Nature.…”</p>

<p>But Froebel is far ahead of this. The great law to
him is the Law of Development to which Man and
Nature, which includes Man, are subject. The ethical
interest is not, as Mr. Winch intimates, something
transcending Nature, but is itself evolved. Morality,
Froebel distinctly tells us, is “rooted” in Instinct, and
“human development means spiritual development.”</p>

<p>Professor O’Shea says of the doctrine of Unfoldment
which he attributes to Froebel that it “regards
man on his spiritual side as an entity set apart from
everything in the universe.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Froebel, however, writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Difficult, very difficult, would it be to define
where the purely physical ends and the purely
intellectual begins. It is precisely on account of
this close welding or flowing into one another of
the Physical and Psychical, the bodily and mental,
the material and spiritual, the vital (des Vitalen)
and intellectual, instinct and morality; it is
because of this rooting of the higher in the lower
that the training and ennobling of the senses,
such as smell and taste, are so important.”&mdash;<cite>M.,
p. 183.</cite></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>“Training and ennobling,” these words bring us
back to the educational doctrines Froebel based upon
what he knew of development, physical and mental,
from whatever source he may have gained his information.</p>

<p>“From the beginning of the Darwinian reconstruction
of the moral sciences,” says Mr. Graham
Wallas, “it was absurd, while speaking of ‘environment,’
to ignore the fact that the deliberate care and
contrivance of the parent must form a large part of
the environment of the child.” Undoubtedly.</p>

<p>But it was because Froebel exalted “the deliberate
care and contrivance of the parent” that he wrote
“The Education of Man,” to tell his generation how
best to care and contrive. It was because he realized
that this deliberate care and contrivance must begin
from the very first that he wrote his Mother Songs.
He tells the mother here that “if she is wise, in all
she does a noble meaning lies”; that she must “do
nothing aimlessly or she’ll create a child she cannot
educate.” He tells her that it is “by watching what
makes the child’s eyes bright, that she will know how
best to give delight,” and that she must “seek to
strengthen power and mind in all things.”</p>

<p>In very truth the Kindergarten itself, with all its
imperfections, is nothing more nor less than an attempt
to supply that very environment which its founder is
supposed to undervalue&mdash;an attempt to foster, by
providing suitable conditions, those innate tendencies
or natural activities, to which Froebel attached infinite
importance.</p>

<p>This is why the discovery of the name Kindergarten
gave Froebel the pleasure expressed in his cry,
“Eureka, I have it! Kindergarten shall be its name.”
The original designation contained the actual words
“through the culture of the instinct for activity,
inquiry and creation, inherent in man,” but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
original title spreads over several lines of print. “Garden”
to Froebel expresses just what he wanted, “As
in a garden under God’s favour, and <em>by the care of a
skilled, intelligent gardener</em>, growing plants are cultivated
in accordance with Nature’s laws, so here, in
our child-garden, shall the noblest of all growing
things, <em>men</em> (that is, children, the germs and shoots
of humanity), be cultivated in accordance with the
laws of their own being, of God and of Nature.”&mdash;<cite>L.,
p. 161.</cite></p>

<p>This is why he urges on his pupil, Ida Seele, to
retain the name in spite of the prejudices it aroused.
It is to her that he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is there really such importance underlying
the mere name of a system?&mdash;some one might
ask. Yes, there is: … It is true that any one
carefully watching your teaching would observe
a new spirit … you would strike him as personally
capable, nay, as extremely capable, but
you would fail to strike him as priestess of the idea,
and of the struggle towards the realization of the
idea&mdash;education by development&mdash;the destined
means of raising the whole human race. For,
after all, what do we mean by ‘Kindergarten’?…
No man can acquire fresh knowledge beyond
the measure which his own mental strength and
stage of development fits him to receive. But
little children have no development at all.…
Infant schools are nothing but a contradiction of
child nature. Little children ought not to be
<em>schooled</em> and taught, they merely need to be
developed. It is the pressing need of our age,
and only the idea of a garden can serve to show
us symbolically the proper treatment of children.
This idea lies in the very name of a Kindergarten.
… How much better had you been able to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
your work by its proper name, and to make
evident by that expression, the real nature of the
new spirit you have introduced.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 290.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>There is no gulf between the Kindergarten, and
“The Education of Man,” with its appeal to educators
to follow instead of interfering with Nature’s methods,
to foster instead of repressing the “instincts of
activity and of construction,” to foster play, which
though “merely natural life,” yet holds “the seed
leaves of all later life.”</p>

<p>Froebel’s gardener is “skilled and intelligent,” and
a skilled gardener is supposed to have scientific knowledge
of his plants, of the conditions of soil, exposure,
etc., best suited to them. Professor Adams says that
“to call a child a plant does not advance matters
much, and it certainly does not account for the use of
the cubes, spheres and such like.” This, however, it
does most certainly if these cubes and spheres are the
right food material for the child’s mind, as Froebel at
any rate believed.</p>

<p>All the employments of the Kindergarten, all the
varied materials, the sand and clay, the pencil and
paint brush, the building blocks, cardboard, sawdust,
moss, nut-shells, etc., for constructive or “representative”
play are definitely mentioned and definitely
commended in “The Education of Man.” They are
commended because they are the employments and
the material which children everywhere find for themselves;
because Froebel had sufficient knowledge of
biology to know that instinctive action must somehow
benefit the individual and the race; and also because
he had psychological insight enough to see that by such
activities children gain not merely skill, but clear ideas
and “firmness of will.”</p>

<p>Professor Adams writes: “Not Philosophy, but
common sense, experience and loving observation, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
led Froebel and his followers to adopt certain apparatus
and certain methods, which are excellent in themselves,
and which in capable hands produce admirable
results. For this he deserves all the honour that has
been heaped upon him&mdash;but he has not explained John.”</p>

<p>True enough, Froebel has not explained, at least,
he has not entirely explained that charming John, the
Professor’s own creation and type of all our children.
Who has? Still, by his efforts as a pioneer in genetic
psychology&mdash;the result of his belief that “only by the
study of development in ourselves and others, can we
learn to understand the child”&mdash;and by the two
sketches so full of insight into child-life and into boy
life, which he has given us in “The Education of
Man,” surely Froebel has done at least his share even
in explaining John.</p>

<p>No doubt he learnt much from “loving observation.”
Nor does he undervalue it, but, in his case,
the observation was induced by the Philosophy, as well
as by the love. For, as he tells us, “it is a necessary
part of me to be irresistibly driven to search out the
ultimate cause of every fact in life, to discover its
roots.” He learned much from watching both mothers
and children, but he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What natural mother wit and human
common sense left to themselves, have been
doing by chance and piece-meal, ought now to be
brought forward by a thoughtful mind, its foundation,
connections and deeper meaning recognized,
that it may be improved upon by clever
and kindly thought.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 147.</cite></p>

</div>

<p>An education which “follows” needs shown by
the child, which “follows” the laws of development,
physical and mental, as far as these can be discovered
from history, from introspection, and from observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of children in general and of “each individual child,”
that is the “patiently following” education which
Froebel puts before us as an ideal. “For,” he says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By the full application of the latter method
of education, the prescribing and interfering, we
should wholly lose the sure, steady and progressive
development of mankind, which is the ultimate
aim and object of all education.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 10.</cite></p>

</div>

<div class="smaller">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The foregoing chapter was written some years ago, but
in 1912 there appeared a fresh criticism of Froebel and his work in
many ways more adequate than certain others. It appeared as an
Introduction to a new translation of “The Education of Man” and of
some of Froebel’s lesser writings, by Dr. Fletcher and Professor
Welton. In this introduction, important points are granted, for
example, that Froebel had “grasped the vital principle that all true
development, and consequently all true education, is a self-directed
process&mdash;that purpose is the key-note of human culture and advance.
It was the emphasis which he laid upon this which makes Froebel
one of the princes of education and gives him an enduring place in
the history of thought.” Or again, that Froebel’s teaching is “not
the negation of all human constraint,” but that he sees clearly that
“constraint is necessary to train the will to resist impulse and follow
purpose”; that with Froebel “Discipline must direct instinctive
impulse, not simply oppose and thwart it.” Unfortunately, however,
the writers of the book do not seem to have grasped the idea of the
Kindergarten as an Institution which had this very end in view, and
the second part of the book which is called “The Kindergarten,” never
mentions its essential features. So we have the familiar statement
that between the Kindergarten and “The Education of Man” a gulf is
fixed, a statement which has been already discussed. And we are
also told that Froebel attracts us “by his very vagueness.” But
Keilhau and Helba and the real Kindergarten are none of them
vague. That Froebel attributed too much importance to his Gifts
and occupations most of us will readily allow, but that the forms
of expression set forth in the Helba plan are to be regarded as merely
additions to the Gifts is impossible seeing that the plan for Helba is
dated 1829. Besides, all such work had already been very much in
evidence at Keilhau (See <a href="#Page_v"><cite>p. v</cite>, Preface</a>), and the Gifts and Occupations
were an attempt to provide in a similar manner for children
very much younger, and as materials are only such as children find for
themselves. We claim that Froebel himself is the best interpreter
of his own invention, the Kindergarten, and we are content to abide
by his own definition of it: <em>An Institution for the cultivation of the
life of mankind through fostering the impulse to activity, investigation
and construction in the child; an institution for the self-instruction, for
self-education of mankind through play, that is creative self-activity and
spontaneous self-instruction</em>.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_I">APPENDIX I<br />
<span class="smcap">On the Meaning of the Word “Activity”</span></h2>

<p>Professor Stout is particularly definite in his
use of the word “activity,” and as he agrees
with Mr. Bradley, from whom he quotes “that the
current use of the word activity in the literature of
philosophy is a scandal,” it may be well to inquire
here whether Froebel used the word loosely or with
some degree of definiteness.</p>

<p>Professor Stout considers the word “activity”
specially appropriate to cases “in which the return
of a causal process upon itself is especially prominent
or important.” He quotes from Mr. Bradley again
that “Activity seems to be self-caused change. A
transition that begins with, and comes out of the thing
itself is the process where we feel that it is active.”
“Thus,” Mr. Stout comments, “the life and growth
of organisms are specially appropriate examples of
activity; for such processes are in a large measure
immanent or self-determining.”</p>

<p>The first point that suggests itself is that in the
majority of cases, Froebel may perhaps be said to have
avoided the difficulty by his constant reference not
only to activity but to “self-activity,” a word associated
with the name of Froebel closely as his very
shadow.</p>

<p>In the second place, we do find Froebel very
markedly referring to the self-determining activity of
organisms, in a passage where he is trying to show
that all instruction should start from the child’s own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
desire and power of will. He says that the mother&mdash;grounding
her instruction in her child’s desire to write
to the absent father&mdash;acts like the sun, “whose
warmth awakens in every grain of seed, life, impulse,
power, self-activity, self-determination” (die Triebe,
die Kraft, die Selbstthätigkeit und Selbstbestimmung).<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>It is Froebel’s peculiarity that he brings his philosophical
conceptions into the veriest details, and so
even in speaking of how the mother may make a ball
represent a springing kitten, etc., and saying that to
the child the ball is “the uniting object,” yet, he says,
considering the plays as proceeding from the child
(vom Kinde aus), “all activity, though mediated
(vermittelt) by the ball, proceeds definitely from the
child, and though going through the ball, refers back
again to the child, who is himself a unit.”</p>

<p>There is a particular passage which suggests that
there existed a special definite idea in Froebel’s mind
in regard to the word “activity,” and it is one which
presents a difficulty to an ordinary and unphilosophical
mind, though a possible light is thrown upon
it by Mr. Bradley’s definition. In this passage
activity (Thätigkeit) is very distinctly given as something
higher than impulse (Triebe).</p>

<p>The working of the primeval Cause, “the uniting,”
is called, Froebel says, “according to the different
stages in development, Force, Impulse, Life, Life-impulse,
Activity” (Wirken, Trieb, Leben, Lebenstrieb,
Thätigkeit).</p>

<p>This placing of activity so high in the scale is at
least no accident, and conscious self-determination is
constantly attributed to man as “the most perfect
earthly being,” and to man alone.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Stout proceeds to examine the conception of
self-determining process, with special reference to
changes within the sphere of an individual consciousness,
taking as the most convenient point of departure,
such illustrative analogies as come from the physical
world, and beginning with the simplest form of self-determination,
the law of inertia.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>“Conscious life,” he says, “is always in some
degree self-sustaining, this indeed is an indispensable
part of the connotation of all such words as activity,
endeavour, conation, effort, striving, will, attention.
All such terms imply that the process to which they
refer, tends by its intrinsic nature in a certain direction,
or toward a certain end.”</p>

<p>Now the word “endeavour” or “effort” (Streben)
is a word Froebel constantly uses in speaking of
a child’s activity, and he does more than merely
“imply” that this process “tends in a certain
direction, or toward a certain end” when he affirms
that “In every activity, in every deed of man, and of
the smallest child, an aim is expressed.”</p>

<p>Professor Stout goes on to say that in conscious
states we can always distinguish between determination
from within and from without, and “it is a point
of vital significance that this distinction coincides with
that between mental activity and mental passivity.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
With mental passivity Froebel has but few dealings,
if indeed he has any. There is one passage in which
he uses the word passive (passiv); this, however,
merely states that the child, in accommodating himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to his surroundings, may outwardly appear inactive
or passive, but only in order to have more scope for
his inner activity (wo es äusserlich als unthätig, leidend
[passiv] erscheint … um so seiner innern Thätigkeit
mehr Spielraum zu verschaffen).</p>

<p>From what he does say there is little doubt but
that Froebel would willingly have subscribed to Professor
Stout’s dictum, “that to be mentally active is
identical with being mentally alive or awake,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> though
in degree the activity may shade off gradually from
that “involving a sense of strain, to that of almost
passivity.” But just as Professor Stout rejects the
idea of purely passive consciousness, so, too, does he
reject “pure” mental activity. “It is impossible to
find any bit of mental process which is determined
purely from within.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>… “At the same time it is
equally true that no change within is entirely determined
from without.”<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Mr. Stout does not say that
pure activity&mdash;a purely self-determined process&mdash;cannot
exist, for “we should, by parity of reasoning, be
bound to reject the second law of motion.”<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> “But
it rests,” he says, “with the advocates of pure activity,
if there are such, to adduce a case of it, and until such
a case is brought forward we must assume that there
is none.… No portion of matter can be, even for a
moment, outside the sphere of influence of other
portions.”</p>

<p>We have seen that Mr. O’Shea practically accuses
Froebel of being an “advocate of pure activity,”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
nor is he the only one of Froebel’s critics who does so.
If, however, it be considered an accident that Froebel
should in one passage put “conscious self-determination”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at the highest point of life development, and in
another passage give this place to “activity” which
Mr. Bradley and Mr. Stout tell us is to be regarded as
self-determined, is it also an accident that in the very
same passage Froebel should state that “everything
in Nature develops and forms itself under the total
collective influence of all other things”?</p>

<p>If these correspondences are not accidental, then
it must be allowed in the first place that Froebel
attached a fairly definite meaning to the word “activity,”
including self-determination in its connotation;
and in the second place that the grounds on which he
is charged with being a believer in “pure activity”
are very insufficient. When Mr. Stout says that even
if it is allowable “as an illustrative hypothesis” to
regard the physical universe as an internally complete
system,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> it is clear that “the stream of individual
consciousness is no such self-contained unit,” but “the
merest fragment of universal reality, as its correlated
brain process is the merest fragment of the material
world<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>”; is this anything but a statement of that
unity, on which Froebel insists in season and out of
season&mdash;which appears on almost every page of his
writings, so that the word has become the veriest
“cant” of the half-trained Kindergarten teacher<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>The philosophic conception of unity, the belief that
there is no separation in either world, physical or
psychical, or between either world, was always
present to Froebel’s mind. “In Nature,” he writes,
“every phenomenon has its sufficient foundation and
its necessary consequence.” But as every philosopher
would say, so Froebel said, “Separation is permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
for the observing, thinking and comparing intellect,
and the outwardly representing life, and is indeed
required by it, but must by no means on that account
be permitted to appear in the mind which is intended
to grasp and constantly to retain in its original inner
union, that which is outwardly apparently separated
by the thinking intellect, the reason and the life.”<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
So Professor Münsterberg, writing as a professed
scientist, says, “Science is to me, not a mass of disconnected
information, … but the certainty that
nothing can exist outside the gigantic mechanism of
causes and effects, but Science is not and cannot be,
and ought never to try to be, an expression of ultimate
reality.”<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>It would never have dawned on Froebel, nor would
it have appealed to him, to separate his philosophy
from his science, but there is no more contradiction
in Froebel’s “self-activity” which is influenced from
without, than there is in Professor Stout when he
speaks of self-determination as included in the connotation
of “activity,” and adds that until a case of
“pure activity” is brought forward, we must assume
that there is none.</p>

<p>Of all his “means of play,” Froebel says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In order, therefore, on the one hand to
introduce the child to the handling of his play
material, we gave him the ball, … but each of
these means of play summons the child in return
to self-activity, to free self-activity; to movement,
to free independent movement” (zur Selbsthätigkeit,
zur freien Selbsthätigkeit; zur Bewegung,
zur freien, inabhängigen Bewegung).<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_II">APPENDIX II<br />
<span class="smcap">Comparison of Plays noted by Froebel with
the Enumeration given by Groos</span></h2>

<p>Much that is given in Groos’ more elaborate
classification can also be found in Froebel’s
suggestions, particularly where younger children are
concerned. For plays coming under the heading of
Playful Activity of the Sensory Apparatus, Froebel
has a parallel for every kind except that of Temperature,
and for this Groos has not himself found anything
that can fairly be called play.</p>

<p>For Sensations of Contact there is the Kicking
Play, and Taste and Smell are also represented in the
Mother Play book. For Hearing play we have the
wooden ball, “a plaything for the child liable to
produce noise by its movement,” as well as the Tic-tac
and Finger Piano plays, and for receptive play, the
mother is told to speak, rhythmically if possible, or to
sing with every play. For Sensations of Brightness
we have “Mother you want to foster this delight in
all things that are sparkling clear and bright” of the
“Fish in the Brook,” as well as “The Lightbird,” which
Froebel has “found over and over again in all grades
of the culture that makes up social life in village and
in town.”</p>

<p>Sensations of colour are well provided for. In
“The Two Windows” we have: “See the beautiful
coloured circles and rays, just like rainbow and dew-drops,
see how beautifully the colours play through
each other.” Colour is a feature in Gift I, in beadwork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
in the tablets, in paper folding, cutting and plaiting,
and besides these there are crayons and paints,
and frequent reference is made to the child’s pleasure
in the colour of flowers.</p>

<p>Froebel also makes much play depend on perception
of form: “Attention to the form and figure of
the object can also be utilized for the child in play,”
or, again, “Early in life the child delights in round and
varied pebbles, he seeks and collects them, he takes
pleasure in the straight edged and right angled.” He
has found “The Target” play very widely spread,
“plainly because it contains, as I see it, the first trace
of an endeavour to make a child notice position and
form.”</p>

<p>For perception of movement, to which Froebel
would have added perception of change of position,
there are many plays with the ball as well as “Tic-tac,”
“The Child and the Pigeons,” “The Lightbird,” “The
Fish in the Brook,” etc.</p>

<p>Groos’ next class is Play with the Motor Apparatus
and under this comes first Playful movement of the
Bodily Organs. Here we have Froebel saying: “The
first toys and occupations of the child come from
himself: he plays with his own limbs.”&mdash;<cite>L., p. 108.</cite>
“The child at this stage begins to play with his
limbs&mdash;his hands, his fingers, his lips, his tongue, his
feet, as well as with the expression of his eyes and
face.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 48.</cite></p>

<p>Under playful locomotion, Groos actually quotes
Froebel’s description of the child learning to walk,
and we have also marching, running, and racing games;
“the large majority,” says Froebel, “I have created
simply by watching the children at play.… Thus
I have prepared a limping-game because I see my
boys always limping and hopping.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>Next comes Playful Movement of Foreign Bodies,
and under this heading Groos gives “Hustling things
about, pushing, pulling, shaking, seizing and pushing
away, dabbling in water, handling sand and clay,
kite-flying, and capture of insects.” Of these Froebel
mentions pushing of carriages, kite-flying, hobby-horse
riding; he makes much of play with water, sand and
clay, and he speaks of the catching of insects, etc.,
desiring that it should be wisely checked by directing
the activity into other channels.</p>

<p>As to Destructive or Analytic Movement Play,
Froebel notes that: “The child wishes to know all the
properties of the thing, for this reason he examines it
on all sides; for this reason he tears and breaks it;
for this reason he puts it in his mouth and bites it.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 73.</cite> “The cruel treatment of insects and other
animals originates in the little boy’s desire to obtain
an insight into the life of the animal.”&mdash;<cite>E., p. 164.</cite></p>

<p>Of Constructive or Synthetic Movement Play, so
much has been said already, that it is not necessary
to dwell on it. Froebel, in fact, gives a far more
inclusive account of this than Groos himself, not
omitting his “simplest form,” viz. moulding new forms
with sand, etc., nor the collecting and arranging in
rows which to Groos and to Froebel is a more primitive
form of construction. Of Exercise of Endurance, too,
we have spoken, in quoting passages where Froebel
shows the boyish desire to measure and to increase
strength. Throwing and Catching Plays have their
place in the “Apprentice and Master Workman”
game.</p>

<p>The important third class, the Playful Use of the
Higher Mental Powers, includes according to Groos
a good deal that he has dealt with under other heads,
e.g. Memory Play includes (<i>a</i>) Recognition and (<i>b</i>)
Reflective Memory. Under the former comes that
pleasure in recognition of form which has already been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
dealt with, the pleasure given by pictures, often, says
Groos, greater than is given by the reality. Froebel,
too, says that if the father makes a sketch, “this man
of lines, this horse of lines, will give the child more
joy than an actual man, an actual horse will do.”&mdash;<cite>E.,
p. 77.</cite> Froebel, too, notes the pleasure it will
give a child to name flowers through recognition of a
form: “Spurred like a rider, circled like a snail, umbrellas,
wheels, he’ll find the names.”&mdash;<cite>M., p. 181.</cite>
There is also the recognition of animal and other
noises, as in Froebel’s Yard Gate. Rote learning as
a play Froebel hardly mentions.</p>

<p>As to the two groups which Groos brings under
the heading of Imagination, viz. “Illusion either playful
or serious,” and “the voluntary or involuntary
transformation of our mental content,” these receive
full recognition. Froebel notes how the stick becomes
a horse or the knotted handkerchief the baby, as well
as the play of listening to and inventing stories.</p>

<p>Under the head of Attention comes such games as
Hide and Seek, because of the alternate stress and
relaxation, and Froebel noted before Darwin did the
pleasure of the baby in Bo-peep. Groos also brings
curiosity under this heading, and we have seen that
Froebel deals fully with such play as the outcome of
the instinct of investigation, or the instinct for self-teaching.</p>

<p>Froebel would certainly not draw the line where
Groos does, when he says “the true characteristics of
play are in inverse ratio to the intensity of the desire
for knowledge,” and if this rule were strictly adhered
to, a good deal of what Groos does call play might have
to come out.</p>

<p>The plays which fall under the head of Reason
have two bearings, says Groos, first causality, and
second inherence. There are various references to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the “joy of being a cause” from the child “whose
capacity for speech is as yet undeveloped,” but who
draws away the support and as the cube falls “turns
to his mother in joyous triumph,” up to the pride of
Keilhau boys, who “might not have accomplished
their fortresses without the sapper,” but “who believed
that if cast on a desert island, each could build
a hut of his own.” Froebel also brings in intellectual
games such as draughts, and he notes how children
will invent their own words and their own alphabets
in play. Of the making and solving of riddles I think
Froebel never speaks.</p>

<p>As to what Groos says of Experimentation with
the feelings, the parallels in Froebel are surprise plays
such as Hide and Seek, adventure and hunting games
where there may be play with fear, and the legends and
stories.</p>

<p>Under the Impulse of the Second or Socionomic order,
come the Fighting Plays, Love Play, Imitative Play,
and Social Play. Of Love Play, Froebel has none,
but the hunting and fighting were allowed abundant
scope at Keilhau. Of Imitative Play there is much
that can be cited from the playful imitation of simple
movements and sounds in the Mother Songs and the
Kindergarten Games, to the “classic dramas” of the
Keilhau boys. Plastic and constructive play, too, goes
from the simplest sand play, through the Kindergarten
handwork, not only up to the fortress making, but
also to the “boxes with locks and hinges, so neatly
finished, veneered, and polished that many a trained
cabinet-maker’s apprentice could have done no better,”
which were made at Keilhau.</p>

<p>Of the Social Plays Groos says with feeling that,
however advisable, it is wellnigh impossible to make a
distinct class. He starts, however, with the “need of
bodily association or the herding instinct.” He brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in the child’s eager desire to be with his fellows, and
the importance in adult life of festivals, religious or
otherwise. He mentions the child’s voluntary submission
to a leader, and speaks of play as instrumental
in teaching children submission to law. We have
noticed Froebel speaking of the “combined games,
which will train the child, by his very nature eager
for companionship, in the habit of association with
comrades, in good fellowship and all that this implies.”
He also wants the child to take alternately some special
part in the game and to be merely one of the crowd:
“Each child should have a chance to lead, for it is
especially developing to a child to recognize himself
as independent as well as a member of the whole.”
Among the older boys, the Bergwachts for instance
were carefully organized under separate leaders and
the captain of the first band was director of the whole.
Froebel, too, made much of festivals at Keilhau, and
this has always been a recognized feature of the Kindergarten.</p>

<p>Enjoyment of the comic never, I think, makes its
appearance at all. Froebel had many gifts, but the
saving sense of humour does not appear to have been
among them.</p>

through the vast orbit of almost two generations (he was nearly fifty-nine)
I have been carried round to the point of commencement, to
the fountain head of the education of mankind, but <em>with the significant
addition of a full consciousness of my task</em>.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Many years ago, a young teacher came to me for help. She had
been told to give her class number lessons, for a whole term, from
Gift III, which consists of eight little cubes, and the children had long
since grasped 4 + 4, 6 + 2, 5 + 3, and 8 - 4, 8 - 2, etc. I suggested
that she should leave the number out and let the children play with
the blocks. “Oh! I mayn’t do that,” was the answer, “they have
building with Gift IV.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> A really pathetic story has been told me of an earnest teacher in far
Australia, whose educational opportunities had been very limited, but
whose desire for knowledge was most sincere. She had been listening
without comprehension to some glib user of phrases, and was bewailing
her ignorance to an enlightened teacher who knew there had been little
of real value, and who said with a laugh “Never mind, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, it is
only a case of ‘Mind and Matter glide swift into the vortex of
immensity.’” And the listener said, “Oh please, would you say that
slowly, and I’ll write it down.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> These objections were embodied in a paper entitled “A Criticism
of Froebelian Pedagogy,” which Mr. Graham Wallas read at a
Conference of the Froebel Society in January 1901, and which was
published in the Conference Supplement for Child Life, July 1901.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Few critics are likely to go so far as Mr. Winch, who gave as a
Froebelian conception “that the true destiny of man is to be obtained
by gratifying every youthful impulse.” But, Mr. Winch is perhaps
not to be taken seriously, for in the same paper he took <em>one sentence
out of a passage on the importance of continuity extending over four pages</em>,
and says of it, “This jerky discontinuity (!) has not the slightest
support in biological science, and never had.” (See Memorandum
written for Mr. Graham Wallas in “Problems of Education.”)</p>

find out how completely we can stand aside, but how far we can so
influence the environment of the child, as to cause those tendencies in
it which we think best, to become permanent.”</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Mr. Graham Wallas said: “From the beginning of the Darwinian
reconstruction of the moral sciences, it was absurd, while speaking of
‘environment,’ to ignore the fact that the deliberate care and contrivance
of the parent must form a large part of the environment of the
child.” The passage quoted shows that Froebel was guilty of no such
absurdity.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
